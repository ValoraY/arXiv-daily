Yet its suitability\nfor precision-sensitive tasks remains unclear. We present the first systematic\nstudy of reasoning for classification tasks under strict low false positive\nrate (FPR) regimes. Our analysis covers two tasks--safety detection and\nhallucination detection--evaluated in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings,\nusing standard LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Our results reveal a\nclear trade-off: Think On (reasoning-augmented) generation improves overall\naccuracy, but underperforms at the low-FPR thresholds essential for practical\nuse. In contrast, Think Off (no reasoning during inference) dominates in these\nprecision-sensitive regimes, with Think On surpassing only when higher FPRs are\nacceptable. In addition, we find token-based scoring substantially outperforms\nself-verbalized confidence for precision-sensitive deployments. Finally, a\nsimple ensemble of the two modes recovers the strengths of each. Taken\ntogether, our findings position reasoning as a double-edged tool: beneficial\nfor average accuracy, but often ill-suited for applications requiring strict\nprecision."}

Inspired by this human capability, we introduce the\nActive Visual Reasoning (AVR) task, extending visual reasoning to partially\nobservable, interactive environments. AVR necessitates agents to: (1) actively\nacquire information via sequential physical actions, (2) integrate observations\nacross multiple steps for coherent reasoning, and (3) dynamically adjust\ndecisions based on evolving visual feedback. To rigorously evaluate AVR, we\nintroduce CLEVR-AVR, a simulation benchmark featuring multi-round interactive\nenvironments designed to assess both reasoning correctness and\ninformation-gathering efficiency. We present AVR-152k, a large-scale dataset\nthat offers rich Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations detailing iterative\nreasoning for uncertainty identification, action-conditioned information gain\nprediction, and information-maximizing action selection, crucial for training\nagents in a higher-order Markov Decision Process.

We propose TokenCLIP, a token-wise\nadaptation framework that enables dynamic alignment between visual and\nlearnable textual spaces for fine-grained anomaly learning. Rather than mapping\nall visual tokens to a single, token-agnostic textual space, TokenCLIP aligns\neach token with a customized textual subspace that represents its visual\ncharacteristics. Explicitly assigning a unique learnable textual space to each\ntoken is computationally intractable and prone to insufficient optimization.

To this end, we formulate dynamic alignment as an\noptimal transport problem, where all visual tokens in an image are transported\nto textual subspaces based on semantic similarity. The transport constraints of\nOT ensure sufficient optimization across subspaces and encourage them to focus\non different semantics. Solving the problem yields a transport plan that\nadaptively assigns each token to semantically relevant subspaces.

MUVR aims\nto retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant segments using multi-modal\nqueries. It has the following features: 1) Practical retrieval paradigm: MUVR\nsupports video-centric multi-modal queries, expressing fine-grained retrieval\nneeds through long text descriptions, video tag prompts, and mask prompts. It\nadopts a one-to-many retrieval paradigm and focuses on untrimmed videos,\ntailored for long-video platform applications. 2) Multi-level visual\ncorrespondence: To cover common video categories (e.g., news, travel, dance)\nand precisely define retrieval matching criteria, we construct multi-level\nvisual correspondence based on core video content (e.g., news events, travel\nlocations, dance moves) which users are interested in and want to retrieve. It\ncovers six levels: copy, event, scene, instance, action, and others. 3)\nComprehensive evaluation criteria: We develop 3 versions of MUVR (i.e., Base,\nFilter, QA). MUVR-Base/Filter evaluates retrieval models, while MUVR-QA\nassesses MLLMs in a question-answering format. We also propose a Reranking\nScore to evaluate the reranking ability of MLLMs. MUVR consists of 53K\nuntrimmed videos from the video platform Bilibili, with 1,050 multi-modal\nqueries and 84K matches. Extensive evaluations of 3 state-of-the-art video\nretrieval models, 6 image-based VLMs, and 10 MLLMs are conducted. MUVR reveals\nthe limitations of retrieval methods in processing untrimmed videos and\nmulti-modal queries, as well as MLLMs in multi-video understanding and\nreranking. Our code and benchmark is available at\nhttps://github.com/debby-0527/MUVR."}

Leveraging a pretrained vision-language\nmodel and our universal prompting strategy, our framework identifies a diverse\nimage-related axes without any prior knowledge. Our universal concept encoder\nadaptively binds visual features to the discovered axes without introducing\nadditional model parameters for each concept. To ground visual concepts along\nthe discovered axes, we optimize a compositional anchoring objective, which\nensures that each axis can be independently manipulated without affecting\nothers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on subsets of\nImageNet, CelebA-HQ, and AFHQ, showcasing superior editing capabilities across\ndiverse real-world concepts that are too varied to be manually predefined.

In this\npaper, we introduce a novel Memory-based online scoring queue scheme for\nTraining-free VAD (MoniTor), to address the inherent complexities in online\nVAD. Specifically, MoniTor applies a streaming input to VLMs, leveraging the\ncapabilities of pre-trained large-scale models. To capture temporal\ndependencies more effectively, we incorporate a novel prediction mechanism\ninspired by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This ensures the model can\neffectively model past states and leverage previous predictions to identify\nanomalous behaviors. Thereby, it better understands the current frame.\nMoreover, we design a scoring queue and an anomaly prior to dynamically store\nrecent scores and cover all anomalies in the monitoring scenario, providing\nguidance for LLMs to distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviors over\ntime. We evaluate MoniTor on two large datasets (i.e., UCF-Crime and\nXD-Violence) containing various surveillance and real-world scenarios.

In this paper, we propose GranViT, a novel Vision Transformer that\nintegrates fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) via region level autoregressive training. We first\nconstruct Gran-29M, a dataset comprising 2million natural and OCR images paired\nwith over 180 million high-quality region-level annotations, to enable large\nscale fine grained pretraining. Consequently, we develop a\npretraining-adaptation framework along with a self distillation mechanism to\ntrain fine-grained GranViT on Gran-29M. We sufficiently exploit the\nfine-grained annotations from Gran-29M to resort to bounding-box-to-caption\nregression to enhance localized visual representation of the vision encoder in\nthe pretraining and caption-to-bounding-box regression to improve vision\nfeature utilization and localization for LLM in the adaptation.
