In\nthis work, we introduce MeasureBench, a benchmark on visual measurement reading\ncovering both real-world and synthesized images of various types of\nmeasurements, along with an extensible pipeline for data synthesis. Our\npipeline procedurally generates a specified type of gauge with controllable\nvisual appearance, enabling scalable variation in key details such as pointers,\nscales, fonts, lighting, and clutter. Evaluation on popular proprietary and\nopen-weight VLMs shows that even the strongest frontier VLMs struggle\nmeasurement reading in general. A consistent failure mode is indicator\nlocalization: models can read digits or labels but misidentify the key\npositions of pointers or alignments, leading to big numeric errors despite\nplausible textual reasoning. We have also conducted preliminary experiments\nwith reinforcement learning over synthetic data, and find encouraging results\non in-domain synthetic subset but less promising for real-world images.

Current\nmethods for generating synthetic geometric data involve rephrasing or expanding\nexisting problems and utilizing predefined rules and templates to create\ngeometric images and problems. However, these approaches often produce data\nthat lacks diversity or is prone to noise. Additionally, the geometric images\nsynthesized by existing methods tend to exhibit limited variation and deviate\nsignificantly from authentic geometric diagrams. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose GeoFM, a novel method for synthesizing geometric data. GeoFM uses\nformal languages to explore combinations of conditions within metric space,\ngenerating high-fidelity geometric problems that differ from the originals\nwhile ensuring correctness through a symbolic engine. Experimental results show\nthat our synthetic data significantly outperforms existing methods. The model\ntrained with our data surpass the proprietary GPT-4o model by 18.7\\% on\ngeometry problem-solving tasks in MathVista and by 16.5\\% on GeoQA.\nAdditionally, it exceeds the performance of a leading open-source model by\n5.7\\% on MathVista and by 2.7\\% on GeoQA."}

The incomplete\nscene information, compounded by image degradation and 4D radar sparsity,\nhinders overall detection performance. In contrast, multi-frame fusion offers\nricher spatiotemporal information but faces two challenges: achieving robust\nand effective object feature fusion across frames and modalities, and\nmitigating the computational cost of redundant feature extraction.\nConsequently, we propose M^3Detection, a unified multi-frame 3D object\ndetection framework that performs multi-level feature fusion on multi-modal\ndata from camera and 4D imaging radar. Our framework leverages intermediate\nfeatures from the baseline detector and employs the tracker to produce\nreference trajectories, improving computational efficiency and providing richer\ninformation for second-stage. In the second stage, we design a global-level\ninter-object feature aggregation module guided by radar information to align\nglobal features across candidate proposals and a local-level inter-grid feature\naggregation module that expands local features along the reference trajectories\nto enhance fine-grained object representation. The aggregated features are then\nprocessed by a trajectory-level multi-frame spatiotemporal reasoning module to\nencode cross-frame interactions and enhance temporal representation.

Underwater\nimage degradation is a widely recognized challenge that interferes with\nunderwater tasks. To improve the robustness of underwater scene understanding,\nwe introduce physical priors derived from underwater imaging models and propose\na plug-and-play vision feature enhancement (VFE) module, which explicitly\nrestores clear underwater information. We integrate this module into renowned\nbaselines LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen2.5-VL and build our underwater LMM, NAUTILUS.\nExperiments conducted on the NautData and public underwater datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the VFE module, consistently improving the\nperformance of both baselines on the majority of supported tasks, thus ensuring\nthe superiority of NAUTILUS in the underwater scene understanding area.

These attacks exploit this\nvulnerability by adding tiny, imperceptible changes to images that, while\nleaving them identical to the human eye, cause the model to make wrong\npredictions. In this work, we propose Adversarially-trained Contrastive\nHard-mining for Optimized Robustness (ANCHOR), a framework that leverages the\npower of supervised contrastive learning with explicit hard positive mining to\nenable the model to learn representations for images such that the embeddings\nfor the images, their augmentations, and their perturbed versions cluster\ntogether in the embedding space along with those for other images of the same\nclass while being separated from images of other classes.

We introduce BEAT, the first framework to\ninject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in\nthe environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit\nwide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant\nreliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that\nspans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger\nvariability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning\n(CTL).
