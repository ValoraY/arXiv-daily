While CNNs like ResNet and YOLO remain highly effective\nfor image-based tasks, recent transformer-based LLMs introduce new capabilities\nsuch as dynamic context reasoning, language-guided prompts, and holistic scene\nunderstanding. However, when used out-of-the-box, the full potential of LLMs\nremains underexploited, often resulting in suboptimal performance on\nspecialized visual tasks. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison\nof fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and\nfine-tuned multi-modal LLMs on the challenging task of artificial text overlay\ndetection in images. A key contribution of our study is demonstrating that LLMs\ncan be effectively fine-tuned on very limited data (fewer than 1,000 images) to\nachieve up to 36% accuracy improvement, matching or surpassing CNN-based\nbaselines that typically require orders of magnitude more data. By exploring\nhow language-guided models can be adapted for precise visual understanding with\nminimal supervision, our work contributes to the broader effort of bridging\nvision and language, offering novel insights into efficient cross-modal\nlearning strategies. These findings highlight the adaptability and data\nefficiency of LLM-based approaches for real-world object detection tasks and\nprovide actionable guidance for applying multi-modal transformers in\nlow-resource visual environments. To support continued progress in this area,\nwe have made the code used to fine-tune the models available in our GitHub,\nenabling future improvements and reuse in related applications."}

However,\nsuch delays often result in non-memorized images that are poorly aligned with\nthe input prompts, highlighting the need to promote earlier escape so that CFG\ncan be applied sooner in the denoising process. In this work, we show that the\ninitial noise sample plays a crucial role in determining when this escape\noccurs. We empirically observe that different initial samples lead to varying\nescape times.

This trend has heightened the need for reliable\ndetection methods to distinguish between human-authored and machine-generated\ncontent. Existing approaches both zero-shot methods and supervised classifiers\nlargely conceptualize this task as a binary classification problem, often\nleading to poor generalization across domains and models. In this paper, we\nargue that such a binary formulation fundamentally mischaracterizes the\ndetection task by assuming a coherent representation of human-written texts. In\nreality, human texts do not constitute a unified distribution, and their\ndiversity cannot be effectively captured through limited sampling. This causes\nprevious classifiers to memorize observed OOD characteristics rather than learn\nthe essence of `non-ID' behavior, limiting generalization to unseen\nhuman-authored inputs. Based on this observation, we propose reframing the\ndetection task as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem, treating\nhuman-written texts as distributional outliers while machine-generated texts\nare in-distribution (ID) samples. To this end, we develop a detection framework\nusing one-class learning method including DeepSVDD and HRN, and score-based\nlearning techniques such as energy-based method, enabling robust and\ngeneralizable performance.

With the rise of multimodal agents, policies that\ngovern visual and multimodal behaviors are critical but remain understudied.\nPrior prompt-compression work mainly shortens task templates and\ndemonstrations, while existing policy-alignment studies focus only on\ntext-based safety rules.

While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly,\nsynthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal\nSemantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise\nimage-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the\ngenerative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and\nvertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication\nmetadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These\nheterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention,\nenabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis\ndemonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low\nWasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under\nmatching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples,\nexemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model\naccuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets,\ndirectly targeting model deficiencies.

However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object\nhallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input\nimage. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key\nfactor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found\nthat there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic\nuncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show\ntheoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that\nexhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations\nindicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a\nsimple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the\nVE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for\nidentifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these\nuncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers\nof the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating\nhallucinations.

With\na granular analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, we uncover two key\ninsights: first, token perception in a rollout trajectory is sparsely\ndistributed, where only a small fraction of tokens have high visual dependency\nfor visually-grounded reasoning; second, different trajectories exhibit\nsignificant divergence in their overall visual dependency.

A hierarchical memory mechanism\nfurther integrates detailed short-term perceptual cues with longer-term\ntrajectory context, enabling stable, coherent reasoning over extended horizons.\nExtensive experiments across four challenging benchmarks (Go Stanford, ReCon,\nSCAND, HuRoN) demonstrate that UniWM substantially improves navigation success\nrates by up to 30%, significantly reduces trajectory errors compared to strong\nbaselines, and exhibits impressive zero-shot generalization on the unseen\nTartanDrive dataset. These results highlight UniWM as a principled step toward\nunified, imagination-driven embodied navigation."}

We present a training-free, inference-time control\nmechanism that makes the flow itself diversity-aware. Our method simultaneously\nencourages lateral spread among trajectories via a feature-space objective and\nreintroduces uncertainty through a time-scheduled stochastic perturbation.\nCrucially, this perturbation is projected to be orthogonal to the generation\nflow, a geometric constraint that allows it to boost variation without\ndegrading image details or prompt fidelity. Our procedure requires no\nretraining or modification to the base sampler and is compatible with common\nflow-matching solvers. Theoretically, our method is shown to monotonically\nincrease a volume surrogate while, due to its geometric constraints,\napproximately preserving the marginal distribution. This provides a principled\nexplanation for why generation quality is robustly maintained. Empirically,\nacross multiple text-to-image settings under fixed sampling budgets, our method\nconsistently improves diversity metrics such as the Vendi Score and Brisque\nover strong baselines, while upholding image quality and alignment."}
