This report conducts a preliminary investigation into the effectiveness and theoretical mechanisms of the Top-$k$ Attention mechanism during both the decoding and training phases. First, we validate the effectiveness of exact Top-$k$ Decoding through extensive experimentation. Experiments demonstrate that retaining only the pivotal Keys with the highest similarity to the Query as the context window during the decoding stage achieves performance comparable to, or even surpassing, full attention on downstream tasks such as HELMET and LongBench v2. Second, we further explore the native Top-$k$ Attention training strategy. Experiments confirm that ensuring the consistency between training and inference regarding Top-$k$ Attention operations facilitates the further unlocking of Top-$k$ Decoding's potential, thereby significantly enhancing model performance. Furthermore, considering the high computational complexity of exact Top-$k$ Attention, we investigate the impact of approximate Top-$k$ algorithm precision on downstream tasks. Our research confirms a positive correlation between downstream task performance and approximation fidelity, and we provide statistical evaluations of the Lightning Indexer's precision within the DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp model. Finally, this report provides a theoretical interpretation from the perspective of Entropy. Experimental observations indicate that models subjected to Top-$k$ Attention SFT exhibit a distinct phenomenon of entropy reduction in downstream tasks, which validates the hypothesis that low-entropy states are better adapted to Top-$k$ Decoding."}

However, LLM output - here, the category assigned to a text - depends heavily on the wording of the prompt. While literature on prompt engineering is expanding, few studies focus on classification tasks, and even fewer address domains like psychology, where constructs have precise, theory-driven definitions that may not be well represented in pre-training data. We present an empirical framework for optimizing LLM performance for identifying constructs in texts via prompt engineering. We experimentally evaluate five prompting strategies --codebook-guided empirical prompt selection, automatic prompt engineering, persona prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and explanatory prompting - with zero-shot and few-shot classification. We find that persona, chain-of-thought, and explanations do not fully address performance loss accompanying a badly worded prompt. Instead, the most influential features of a prompt are the construct definition, task framing, and, to a lesser extent, the examples provided. Across three constructs and two models, the classifications most aligned with expert judgments resulted from a few-shot prompt combining codebook-guided empirical prompt selection with automatic prompt engineering. Based on our findings, we recommend that researchers generate and evaluate as many prompt variants as feasible, whether human-crafted, automatically generated, or ideally both, and select prompts and examples based on empirical performance in a training dataset, validating the final approach in a holdout set. This procedure offers a practical, systematic, and theory-driven method for optimizing LLM prompts in settings where alignment with expert judgment is critical."}

The goal of this paper is to teach LLMs to follow medical consensus guidelines step-by-step in their reasoning and prediction process. Since consensus guidelines are ubiquitous in medicine, instantiations of verbalized medical inference rules to electronic health records provide data for fine-tuning LLMs to learn consensus rules and possible exceptions thereof for many medical areas. Consensus rules also enable an automatic evaluation of the model's inference process regarding its derivation correctness (evaluating correct and faithful deduction of a conclusion from given premises) and value correctness (comparing predicted values against real-world measurements). We exemplify our work using the complex Sepsis-3 consensus definition. Our experiments show that small fine-tuned models outperform one-shot learning of considerably larger LLMs that are prompted with the explicit definition and models that are trained on medical texts including consensus definitions. Since fine-tuning on verbalized rule instantiations of a specific medical area yields nearly perfect derivation correctness for rules (and exceptions) on unseen patient data in that area, the bottleneck for early prediction is not out-of-distribution generalization, but the orthogonal problem of generalization into the future by forecasting sparsely and irregularly sampled clinical variables. We show that the latter results can be improved by integrating the output representations of a time series forecasting model with the LLM in a multimodal setup."}

In this work we aim to leverage the visual capabilities of two multi-modal LLMs, GPT-4o and GPT-5, to perform object counting in a zero-shot manner using only textual prompts. We evaluate both models on the FSC-147 and CARPK datasets and provide a comparative analysis. Our findings show that the models achieve performance comparable to the state-of-the-art zero-shot approaches on FSC-147, in some cases, even surpass them."}

These interactions represent a critical frontier for LLM-based agents, yet existing evaluation methods fail to measure how well these capabilities generalize to novel social situations. In this paper, we introduce a method for evaluating the ability of LLM-based agents to cooperate in zero-shot, mixed-motive environments using Concordia, a natural language multi-agent simulation environment. Our method measures general cooperative intelligence by testing an agent's ability to identify and exploit opportunities for mutual gain across diverse partners and contexts. We present empirical results from the NeurIPS 2024 Concordia Contest, where agents were evaluated on their ability to achieve mutual gains across a suite of diverse scenarios ranging from negotiation to collective action problems. Our findings reveal significant gaps between current agent capabilities and the robust generalization required for reliable cooperation, particularly in scenarios demanding persuasion and norm enforcement."}

We introduce a two-stage large language model (LLM) based method for inferring material composition directly from 3D point clouds with coarse segmentations. Our key insight is to decouple reasoning about what an object is from what it is made of. In the first stage, an LLM predicts the object's semantic; in the second stage, it assigns plausible materials to each geometric segment, conditioned on the inferred semantics. Both stages operate in a zero-shot manner, without task-specific training. Because existing datasets lack reliable material annotations, we evaluate our method using an LLM-as-a-Judge implemented in DeepEval. Across 1,000 shapes from Fusion/ABS and ShapeNet, our method achieves high semantic and material plausibility. These results demonstrate that language models can serve as general-purpose priors for bridging geometric reasoning and material understanding in 3D data."}

Richer rewards computed from the reasoning tokens can improve learning significantly by providing more fine-grained guidance. However, it is challenging to compute more informative rewards in MMRL beyond those based on outcomes since different samples may require different scoring functions and teacher models may provide noisy reward signals too. In this paper, we introduce the Argos (Agentic Reward for Grounded & Objective Scoring), a principled reward agent to train multimodal reasoning models for agentic tasks. For each sample, Argos selects from a pool of teacher-model derived and rule-based scoring functions to simultaneously evaluate: (i) final response accuracy, (ii) spatiotemporal localization of referred entities and actions, and (iii) the quality of the reasoning process. We find that by leveraging our agentic verifier across both SFT data curation and RL training, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple agentic tasks such as spatial reasoning, visual hallucination as well as robotics and embodied AI benchmarks. Critically, we demonstrate that just relying on SFT post-training on highly curated reasoning data is insufficient, as agents invariably collapse to ungrounded solutions during RL without our online verification. We also show that our agentic verifier can help to reduce reward-hacking in MMRL. Finally, we also provide a theoretical justification for the effectiveness of Argos through the concept of pareto-optimality."}

However, achieving practical performance typically requires task-specific fine-tuning with large numbers of image-text pairs, which are costly to collect. In this work, we study text-centric training, a setting where only textual descriptions are available and no real images are provided, as a paradigm for low-cost data scaling. Unlike images, whose collection is often restricted by privacy constraints and scarcity in niche domains, text is widely available. Moreover, text is easily editable, enabling automatic diversification and expansion with LLMs at minimal human effort. While this offers clear advantages over image collection in terms of scalability and cost, training on raw text without images still yields limited gains on VQA tasks because of the image-text modality gap. To address this issue, we propose a Text-Printed Image (TPI), which generates synthetic images by directly rendering the given textual description on a plain white canvas. This simple rendering projects text into the image modality and can be integrated into arbitrary existing LVLM training pipelines at low cost. Moreover, TPI preserves the semantics of the text, whereas text-to-image models often fail to do. Across four models and seven benchmarks, our systematic experiments show that TPI enables more effective text-centric training than synthetic images generated by a diffusion model. We further explore TPI as a low-cost data-augmentation strategy and demonstrate its practical utility. Overall, our findings highlight the significant potential of text-centric training and, more broadly, chart a path toward fully automated data generation for LVLMs."}

MemVerse maintains short-term memory for recent context while transforming raw multimodal experiences into structured long-term memories organized as hierarchical knowledge graphs. This design supports continual consolidation, adaptive forgetting, and bounded memory growth. To handle real-time demands, MemVerse introduces a periodic distillation mechanism that compresses essential knowledge from long-term memory into the parametric model, allowing fast, differentiable recall while preserving interpretability.

The dataset includes over 2000 samples, each composed of a cartographic map, a question (with open-ended or multiple-choice answers), and a ground-truth answer. These tasks span key low-, mid- and high-level map interpretation skills, including symbol recognition, embedded information extraction, scale interpretation, and route-based reasoning.

While existing efficient VLM approaches reduce visual tokens through fixed-ratio compression, they operate passively and lack the ability to adapt to varying task requirements. This motivates a fundamental question: Can VLMs autonomously determine the minimum number of visual tokens required for each sample? Inspired by human active vision mechanisms, we introduce AdaptVision, an efficient VLM paradigm that enables adaptive visual token acquisition through a coarse-to-fine approach. Our model initially processes compressed visual tokens from low-resolution images and selectively acquires additional visual information by invoking a bounding box tool to crop key regions when necessary. We train AdaptVision using a reinforcement learning framework that carefully balances accuracy and efficiency. Central to our approach is Decoupled Turn Policy Optimization (DTPO), which decouples the learning objective into two components: (1) tool learning, which optimizes correct tool utilization, and (2) accuracy improvement, which refines the generated responses to improve answer correctness. Based on this formulation, we further decouple advantage estimation by computing separate advantages for tokens associated with each objective. This formulation enables more effective optimization for AdaptVision compared to vanilla GRPO. Comprehensive experiments across multiple VQA benchmarks demonstrate that AdaptVision achieves superior performance while consuming substantially fewer visual tokens than state-of-the-art efficient VLM methods."}

ViDiC-1K comprises 1,000 curated video pairs annotated with over 4,000 comparative checklist items, covering seven categories: subject, style, background, cinematography, motion, location, and playback techniques.

However, achieving practical performance typically requires task-specific fine-tuning with large numbers of image-text pairs, which are costly to collect. In this work, we study text-centric training, a setting where only textual descriptions are available and no real images are provided, as a paradigm for low-cost data scaling. Unlike images, whose collection is often restricted by privacy constraints and scarcity in niche domains, text is widely available. Moreover, text is easily editable, enabling automatic diversification and expansion with LLMs at minimal human effort. While this offers clear advantages over image collection in terms of scalability and cost, training on raw text without images still yields limited gains on VQA tasks because of the image-text modality gap. To address this issue, we propose a Text-Printed Image (TPI), which generates synthetic images by directly rendering the given textual description on a plain white canvas. This simple rendering projects text into the image modality and can be integrated into arbitrary existing LVLM training pipelines at low cost. Moreover, TPI preserves the semantics of the text, whereas text-to-image models often fail to do. Across four models and seven benchmarks, our systematic experiments show that TPI enables more effective text-centric training than synthetic images generated by a diffusion model. We further explore TPI as a low-cost data-augmentation strategy and demonstrate its practical utility. Overall, our findings highlight the significant potential of text-centric training and, more broadly, chart a path toward fully automated data generation for LVLMs."}

To handle this, prior approaches mainly scale the visual generation process (e.g., increasing sampling steps or seeds), but this quickly leads to a quality plateau. This limitation arises because the prompt, crucial for guiding generation, is kept fixed. To address this, we propose Prompt Redesign for Inference-time Scaling, coined PRIS, a framework that adaptively revises the prompt during inference in response to the scaled visual generations. The core idea of PRIS is to review the generated visuals, identify recurring failure patterns across visuals, and redesign the prompt accordingly before regenerating the visuals with the revised prompt. To provide precise alignment feedback for prompt revision, we introduce a new verifier, element-level factual correction, which evaluates the alignment between prompt attributes and generated visuals at a fine-grained level, achieving more accurate and interpretable assessments than holistic measures. Extensive experiments on both text-to-image and text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, including a 15% gain on VBench 2.0. These results highlight that jointly scaling prompts and visuals is key to fully leveraging scaling laws at inference-time.

While recent diffusion models have shown strong capabilities in text-to-image generation, they struggle to handle structured multi-step scenarios like recipe illustration.

To address these limitations, we present CookAnything, a flexible and consistent diffusion-based framework that generates coherent, semantically distinct image sequences from textual cooking instructions of arbitrary length. The framework introduces three key components: (1) Step-wise Regional Control (SRC), which aligns textual steps with corresponding image regions within a single denoising process; (2) Flexible RoPE, a step-aware positional encoding mechanism that enhances both temporal coherence and spatial diversity; and (3) Cross-Step Consistency Control (CSCC), which maintains fine-grained ingredient consistency across steps. Experimental results on recipe illustration benchmarks show that CookAnything performs better than existing methods in training-based and training-free settings.

To address this gap, we first investigate the mechanism of visual neglect and reveal it can be accurately detected via head-level activation patterns in MLLMs. We thus propose V-ITI, a lightweight visual inference-time intervention framework integrating a Visual Neglect Detector that identifies visual neglect via head-level discriminative probes and a Visual Recall Intervenor that modulates activations with prestored visual activation information only when the visual neglect is detected.

Most existing work relies on manual ROIs and rarely reports quality control (QC). We present LM-CartSeg, a fully automatic pipeline for cartilage/bone segmentation, geometric lateral/medial (L/M) compartmentalisation and radiomics analysis. Methods: Two 3D nnU-Net models were trained on SKM-TEA (138 knees) and OAIZIB-CM (404 knees). At test time, zero-shot predictions were fused and refined by simple geometric rules: connected-component cleaning, construction of 10 mm subchondral bone bands in physical space, and a data-driven tibial L/M split based on PCA and k-means. Segmentation was evaluated on an OAIZIB-CM test set (103 knees) and on SKI-10 (100 knees). QC used volume and thickness signatures. From 10 ROIs we extracted 4 650 non-shape radiomic features to study inter-compartment similarity, dependence on ROI size, and OA vs. non-OA classification on OAIZIB-CM Results: Post-processing improved macro ASSD on OAIZIB-CM from 2.63 to 0.36 mm and HD95 from 25.2 to 3.35 mm, with DSC 0.91; zero-shot DSC on SKI-10 was 0.80. The geometric L/M rule produced stable compartments across datasets, whereas a direct L/M nnU-Net showed domain-dependent side swaps. Only 6 to 12 percent of features per ROI were strongly correlated with volume or thickness. Radiomics-based models models restricted to size-linked features.

While existing efficient VLM approaches reduce visual tokens through fixed-ratio compression, they operate passively and lack the ability to adapt to varying task requirements. This motivates a fundamental question: Can VLMs autonomously determine the minimum number of visual tokens required for each sample? Inspired by human active vision mechanisms, we introduce AdaptVision, an efficient VLM paradigm that enables adaptive visual token acquisition through a coarse-to-fine approach. Our model initially processes compressed visual tokens from low-resolution images and selectively acquires additional visual information by invoking a bounding box tool to crop key regions when necessary. We train AdaptVision using a reinforcement learning framework that carefully balances accuracy and efficiency. Central to our approach is Decoupled Turn Policy Optimization (DTPO), which decouples the learning objective into two components: (1) tool learning, which optimizes correct tool utilization, and (2) accuracy improvement, which refines the generated responses to improve answer correctness. Based on this formulation, we further decouple advantage estimation by computing separate advantages for tokens associated with each objective. This formulation enables more effective optimization for AdaptVision compared to vanilla GRPO. Comprehensive experiments across multiple VQA benchmarks demonstrate that AdaptVision achieves superior performance while consuming substantially fewer visual tokens than state-of-the-art efficient VLM methods."}

However, achieving practical performance typically requires task-specific fine-tuning with large numbers of image-text pairs, which are costly to collect. In this work, we study text-centric training, a setting where only textual descriptions are available and no real images are provided, as a paradigm for low-cost data scaling. Unlike images, whose collection is often restricted by privacy constraints and scarcity in niche domains, text is widely available. Moreover, text is easily editable, enabling automatic diversification and expansion with LLMs at minimal human effort. While this offers clear advantages over image collection in terms of scalability and cost, training on raw text without images still yields limited gains on VQA tasks because of the image-text modality gap. To address this issue, we propose a Text-Printed Image (TPI), which generates synthetic images by directly rendering the given textual description on a plain white canvas. This simple rendering projects text into the image modality and can be integrated into arbitrary existing LVLM training pipelines at low cost. Moreover, TPI preserves the semantics of the text, whereas text-to-image models often fail to do. Across four models and seven benchmarks, our systematic experiments show that TPI enables more effective text-centric training than synthetic images generated by a diffusion model. We further explore TPI as a low-cost data-augmentation strategy and demonstrate its practical utility. Overall, our findings highlight the significant potential of text-centric training and, more broadly, chart a path toward fully automated data generation for LVLMs."}

A multi-scale token reconstruction decoder enables anatomical segmentation, while shared global representations support disease classification and clinically grounded text output allowing the model to transition from pixels to structures and finally clinical reasoning within one architecture.

Existing approaches primarily analyze how an action is performed, while overlooking what it produces, i.e., the \\textbf{action effect}.

To address this gap, we propose Action Effect Modeling (AEM), a unified framework that jointly captures action execution and its outcomes through a probabilistic formulation. AEM first identifies the outcome of an action by selecting the most informative effect frame based on semantic relevance and visual quality. It then extracts complementary cues from visual grounding and symbolic scene graphs, aligning them in a shared latent space to form robust effect-aware representations. To detect mistakes, we further design a prompt-based detector that incorporates task-specific prompts and aligns each action segment with its intended execution semantics. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the EgoPER and CaptainCook4D benchmarks under the challenging one-class classification (OCC) setting. These results demonstrate that modeling both execution and outcome yields more reliable mistake detection, and highlight the potential of effect-aware representations to benefit a broader range of downstream applications."}

DIQ-H applies physics-based corruptions including motion blur, sensor noise, and compression artifacts, and measures hallucination persistence, error recovery, and temporal consistency through multi-turn question-answering tasks. To enable scalable annotation, we propose Uncertainty-Guided Iterative Refinement (UIR), which generates reliable pseudo-ground-truth using lightweight VLMs with uncertainty filtering, achieving a 15.3 percent accuracy improvement.

However, in text-to-image(T2I) diffusion models, most related works focus on search strategies and reward models, yet the impact of the stochastic characteristic of noise in T2I diffusion models on the method's performance remains unexplored. In this work, we analyze the effects of randomness in T2I diffusion models and explore a new format of randomness for TTS: text embedding perturbation, which couples with existing randomness like SDE-injected noise to enhance generative diversity and quality. We start with a frequency-domain analysis of these formats of randomness and their impact on generation, and find that these two randomness exhibit complementary behavior in the frequency domain: spatial noise favors low-frequency components (early steps), while text embedding perturbation enhances high-frequency details (later steps), thereby compensating for the potential limitations of spatial noise randomness in high-frequency manipulation. Concurrently, text embedding demonstrates varying levels of tolerance to perturbation across different dimensions of the generation process. Specifically, our method consists of two key designs: (1) Introducing step-based text embedding perturbation, combining frequency-guided noise schedules with spatial noise perturbation. (2) Adapting the perturbation intensity selectively based on their frequency-specific contributions to generation and tolerance to perturbation. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated into existing TTS methods and demonstrates significant improvements on multiple benchmarks with almost no additional computation.

We first identify and validate a query typology distinguishing between global query and localized query. We demonstrate that while uniform sampling is both effective and efficient for global queries, localized queries indeed necessitate query-aware selection for optimal performance. Building on this insight, we propose DIG, a training-free frame selection framework that adapts its strategy based on the query type. Specifically,DIG employs efficient uniform sampling for global queries while activating a specialized pipeline to extract query-relevant frames for localized queries. Experiments on three long-form video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that DIG consistently outperforms existing baselines and robustly improves LMM performance, even when scaling the input frame count to 256."}

This challenge has driven the development of efficient attention mechanisms, with sparsity emerging as the dominant paradigm. Current methods typically retain or discard entire key-value blocks with binary masks, resulting in substantial information loss under high sparsity. To mitigate this gap, we present Pyramid Sparse Attention (PSA), a versatile module applicable to both video understanding and generation tasks. Instead of binary masking, PSA introduces multi-level pooled KV representations, enabling finer mask granularity. Specifically, each query block dynamically allocates lower pooling levels to critical KV blocks and higher levels to less important ones, creating an informative interpolation between full retention and complete pruning. This design, analogous to fixed-point quantization and classical feature pyramid networks in computer vision, effectively mitigates information loss while preserving computational efficiency under a low compute budget. It works with a native, hardware-friendly kernel that leverages decoupled block-tile design to ensure efficient execution. Across video understanding and generation benchmarks, PSA preserves contextual information and visual fidelity, consistently outperforming or achieving comparable performance over existing sparse attention baselines with superior efficiency-quality trade-offs.

To address these issues, we introduce OpenTrack3D, a generalizable and accurate framework. Unlike methods that rely on pre-generated proposals, OpenTrack3D employs a novel visual-spatial tracker to construct cross-view consistent object proposals online.

To handle this, prior approaches mainly scale the visual generation process (e.g., increasing sampling steps or seeds), but this quickly leads to a quality plateau. This limitation arises because the prompt, crucial for guiding generation, is kept fixed. To address this, we propose Prompt Redesign for Inference-time Scaling, coined PRIS, a framework that adaptively revises the prompt during inference in response to the scaled visual generations. The core idea of PRIS is to review the generated visuals, identify recurring failure patterns across visuals, and redesign the prompt accordingly before regenerating the visuals with the revised prompt. To provide precise alignment feedback for prompt revision, we introduce a new verifier, element-level factual correction, which evaluates the alignment between prompt attributes and generated visuals at a fine-grained level, achieving more accurate and interpretable assessments than holistic measures. Extensive experiments on both text-to-image and text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, including a 15% gain on VBench 2.0.

To address this gap, we first investigate the mechanism of visual neglect and reveal it can be accurately detected via head-level activation patterns in MLLMs. We thus propose V-ITI, a lightweight visual inference-time intervention framework integrating a Visual Neglect Detector that identifies visual neglect via head-level discriminative probes and a Visual Recall Intervenor that modulates activations with prestored visual activation information only when the visual neglect is detected.

Incorporating multiple markers (e.g., immunohistochemistry, IHC) alongside H&E enriches H&E-based features with diverse, biologically meaningful information. However, progress is limited by the scarcity of well-aligned multi-stain datasets. Inter-stain misalignment shifts corresponding tissue across slides, hindering consistent patch-level features and degrading slide-level embeddings. To address this, we curated a slide-level aligned, five-stain dataset (H&E, HER2, KI67, ER, PGR) to enable paired H&E-IHC learning and robust cross-stain representation. Leveraging this dataset, we propose Cross-Stain Contrastive Learning (CSCL), a two-stage pretraining framework with a lightweight adapter trained using patch-wise contrastive alignment to improve the compatibility of H&E features with corresponding IHC-derived contextual cues, and slide-level representation learning with Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), which uses a cross-stain attention fusion module to integrate stain-specific patch features and a cross-stain global alignment module to enforce consistency among slide-level embeddings across different stains. Experiments on cancer subtype classification, IHC biomarker status classification, and survival prediction show consistent gains, yielding high-quality, transferable H&E slide-level representations.

Although recent diffusion-based approaches improve upon traditional optical-flow-based methods, they still struggle to cover diverse application scenarios and often fail to produce sharp, temporally consistent frames in fine-grained motion tasks such as audio-visual synchronized interpolation. To address these limitations, we introduce BBF (Beyond Boundary Frames), a context-aware video frame interpolation framework, which could be guided by audio/visual semantics. First, we enhance the input design of the interpolation model so that it can flexibly handle multiple conditional modalities, including text, audio, images, and video. Second, we propose a decoupled multimodal fusion mechanism that sequentially injects different conditional signals into a DiT backbone. Finally, to maintain the generation abilities of the foundation model, we adopt a progressive multi-stage training paradigm, where the start-end frame difference embedding is used to dynamically adjust both the data sampling and the loss weighting. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that BBF outperforms specialized state-of-the-art methods on both generic interpolation and audio-visual synchronized interpolation tasks, establishing a unified framework for video frame interpolation under coordinated multi-channel conditioning."}

In this paper, we introduce GaussianBlender, a pioneering feed-forward framework for text-driven 3D stylization that performs edits instantly at inference. Our method learns structured, disentangled latent spaces with controlled information sharing for geometry and appearance from spatially-grouped 3D Gaussians. A latent diffusion model then applies text-conditioned edits on these learned representations.

The pose-conditioned anchor attention mechanism enables the model to better align instruction semantics with actionable visual cues, thereby improving action generation precision and efficiency.

To address this issue, we propose a Dual-level Modality Debiasing Learning (DMDL) framework that implements debiasing at both the model and optimization levels. At the model level, we propose a Causality-inspired Adjustment Intervention (CAI) module that replaces likelihood-based modeling with causal modeling, preventing modality-induced spurious patterns from being introduced, leading to a low-biased model.

To address this, we propose CodeVision, a flexible and scalable code-as-tool framework where the model generates code as a universal interface to invoke any image operation, moving beyond fixed tool registries.

We introduce SelfDebias, a fully unsupervised test-time debiasing method applicable to any diffusion model that uses a UNet as its noise predictor. SelfDebias identifies semantic clusters in an image encoder's embedding space and uses these clusters to guide the diffusion process during inference, minimizing the KL divergence between the output distribution and the uniform distribution. Unlike supervised approaches, SelfDebias does not require human-annotated datasets or external classifiers trained for each generated concept. Instead, it is designed to automatically identify semantic modes. Extensive experiments show that SelfDebias generalizes across prompts and diffusion model architectures, including both conditional and unconditional models. It not only effectively debiases images along key demographic dimensions while maintaining the visual fidelity of the generated images, but also more abstract concepts for which identifying biases is also challenging."}

While existing efficient VLM approaches reduce visual tokens through fixed-ratio compression, they operate passively and lack the ability to adapt to varying task requirements. This motivates a fundamental question: Can VLMs autonomously determine the minimum number of visual tokens required for each sample? Inspired by human active vision mechanisms, we introduce AdaptVision, an efficient VLM paradigm that enables adaptive visual token acquisition through a coarse-to-fine approach. Our model initially processes compressed visual tokens from low-resolution images and selectively acquires additional visual information by invoking a bounding box tool to crop key regions when necessary. We train AdaptVision using a reinforcement learning framework that carefully balances accuracy and efficiency. Central to our approach is Decoupled Turn Policy Optimization (DTPO), which decouples the learning objective into two components: (1) tool learning, which optimizes correct tool utilization, and (2) accuracy improvement, which refines the generated responses to improve answer correctness. Based on this formulation, we further decouple advantage estimation by computing separate advantages for tokens associated with each objective. This formulation enables more effective optimization for AdaptVision compared to vanilla GRPO. Comprehensive experiments across multiple VQA benchmarks demonstrate that AdaptVision achieves superior performance while consuming substantially fewer visual tokens than state-of-the-art efficient VLM methods."}

First, despite pioneering the use of diffusion models in DD and delivering impressive performance, the vast majority of approaches paradoxically require a diffusion model pre-trained on the full target dataset, undermining the very purpose of DD and incurring prohibitive training costs. Second, although some methods turn to general text-to-image models without relying on such target-specific training, they suffer from a significant distributional mismatch, as the web-scale priors encapsulated in these foundation models fail to faithfully capture the target-specific semantics, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose Core Distribution Alignment (CoDA), a framework that enables effective DD using only an off-the-shelf text-to-image model. Our key idea is to first identify the \"intrinsic core distribution\" of the target dataset using a robust density-based discovery mechanism. We then steer the generative process to align the generated samples with this core distribution. By doing so, CoDA effectively bridges the gap between general-purpose generative priors and target semantics, yielding highly representative distilled datasets. Extensive experiments suggest that, without relying on a generative model specifically trained on the target dataset, CoDA achieves performance on par with or even superior to previous methods with such reliance across all benchmarks, including ImageNet-1K and its subsets.

A multi-scale token reconstruction decoder enables anatomical segmentation, while shared global representations support disease classification and clinically grounded text output allowing the model to transition from pixels to structures and finally clinical reasoning within one architecture.

We start with a frequency-domain analysis of these formats of randomness and their impact on generation, and find that these two randomness exhibit complementary behavior in the frequency domain: spatial noise favors low-frequency components (early steps), while text embedding perturbation enhances high-frequency details (later steps), thereby compensating for the potential limitations of spatial noise randomness in high-frequency manipulation. Concurrently, text embedding demonstrates varying levels of tolerance to perturbation across different dimensions of the generation process. Specifically, our method consists of two key designs: (1) Introducing step-based text embedding perturbation, combining frequency-guided noise schedules with spatial noise perturbation. (2) Adapting the perturbation intensity selectively based on their frequency-specific contributions to generation and tolerance to perturbation. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated into existing TTS methods and demonstrates significant improvements on multiple benchmarks with almost no additional computation.

Consequently, recent research has focused on query-aware frame selection, methods that often incur significant computational overhead. This paper challenges the assumption that such complex search mechanisms are universally necessary. We first identify and validate a query typology distinguishing between global query and localized query. We demonstrate that while uniform sampling is both effective and efficient for global queries, localized queries indeed necessitate query-aware selection for optimal performance. Building on this insight, we propose DIG, a training-free frame selection framework that adapts its strategy based on the query type. Specifically,DIG employs efficient uniform sampling for global queries while activating a specialized pipeline to extract query-relevant frames for localized queries. Experiments on three long-form video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that DIG consistently outperforms existing baselines and robustly improves LMM performance, even when scaling the input frame count to 256."}

Among these INR-based video codecs, Neural Video Representation Compression (NVRC) was the first to adopt a fully end-to-end compression framework that compresses INRs, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, some recently proposed lightweight INRs have shown comparable performance to their baseline codecs with computational complexity lower than 10kMACs/pixel. In this work, we extend NVRC toward lightweight representations, and propose NVRC-Lite, which incorporates two key changes. Firstly, we integrated multi-scale feature grids into our lightweight neural representation, and the use of higher resolution grids significantly improves the performance of INRs at low complexity. Secondly, we address the issue that existing INRs typically leverage autoregressive models for entropy coding: these are effective but impractical due to their slow coding speed. In this work, we propose an octree-based context model for entropy coding high-dimensional feature grids, which accelerates the entropy coding module of the model. Our experimental results demonstrate that NVRC-Lite outperforms C3, one of the best lightweight INR-based video codecs, with up to 21.03% and 23.06% BD-rate savings when measured in PSNR and MS-SSIM, respectively, while achieving 8.4x encoding and 2.5x decoding speedup. The implementation of NVRC-Lite will be made available."}

This challenge has driven the development of efficient attention mechanisms, with sparsity emerging as the dominant paradigm. Current methods typically retain or discard entire key-value blocks with binary masks, resulting in substantial information loss under high sparsity. To mitigate this gap, we present Pyramid Sparse Attention (PSA), a versatile module applicable to both video understanding and generation tasks. Instead of binary masking, PSA introduces multi-level pooled KV representations, enabling finer mask granularity. Specifically, each query block dynamically allocates lower pooling levels to critical KV blocks and higher levels to less important ones, creating an informative interpolation between full retention and complete pruning. This design, analogous to fixed-point quantization and classical feature pyramid networks in computer vision, effectively mitigates information loss while preserving computational efficiency under a low compute budget. It works with a native, hardware-friendly kernel that leverages decoupled block-tile design to ensure efficient execution. Across video understanding and generation benchmarks, PSA preserves contextual information and visual fidelity, consistently outperforming or achieving comparable performance over existing sparse attention baselines with superior efficiency-quality trade-offs.

Recent advances have explored automating this process using Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), yet existing methods often produce geometrically inaccurate layouts and lack the iterative, layer-specific editing required in professional workflows. To address these limitations, we present PosterCopilot, a framework that advances layout reasoning and controllable editing for professional graphic design. Specifically, we introduce a progressive three-stage training strategy that equips LMMs with geometric understanding and aesthetic reasoning for layout design, consisting of Perturbed Supervised Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning for Visual-Reality Alignment, and Reinforcement Learning from Aesthetic Feedback. Furthermore, we develop a complete workflow that couples the trained LMM-based design model with generative models, enabling layer-controllable, iterative editing for precise element refinement while maintaining global visual consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PosterCopilot achieves geometrically accurate and aesthetically superior layouts, offering unprecedented controllability for professional iterative design."}

We leverage the multiple viewpoints naturally captured within a single life to learn a visual encoder in a self-supervised manner. Our experiments demonstrate three key findings. First, models trained independently on different lives develop a highly aligned geometric understanding. We demonstrate this by training visual encoders on distinct datasets each capturing a different life, both indoors and outdoors, as well as introducing a novel cross-attention-based metric to quantify the functional alignment of the internal representations developed by different models. Second, we show that single-life models learn generalizable geometric representations that effectively transfer to downstream tasks, such as depth estimation, in unseen environments. Third, we demonstrate that training on up to 30 hours from one week of the same person's life leads to comparable performance to training on 30 hours of diverse web data, highlighting the strength of single-life representation learning. Overall, our results establish that the shared structure of the world, both leads to consistency in models trained on individual lives, and provides a powerful signal for visual representation learning."}
