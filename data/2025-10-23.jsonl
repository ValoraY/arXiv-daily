We introduce the Music Understanding and Structural\nEvaluation (MUSE) Benchmark, an open-source resource with 10 tasks designed to\nprobe fundamental music perception skills. We evaluate four SOTA models (Gemini\nPro and Flash, Qwen2.5-Omni, and Audio-Flamingo 3) against a large human\nbaseline (N=200). Our results reveal a wide variance in SOTA capabilities and a\npersistent gap with human experts.

As an important component of\nHuman-Centric applications, Human Pose representations are critical in many\ndownstream tasks, such as Human Pose Estimation, Action Recognition,\nHuman-Computer Interaction, Object tracking, etc. Human Pose representations or\nembeddings can be extracted from images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh\nmodels, and lots of other modalities. Yet, there are limited instances where\nthe correlation among all of those representations has been clearly researched\nusing a contrastive paradigm. In this paper, we propose UniHPR, a unified Human\nPose Representation learning pipeline, which aligns Human Pose embeddings from\nimages, 2D and 3D human poses. To align more than two data representations at\nthe same time, we propose a novel singular value-based contrastive learning\nloss, which better aligns different modalities and further boosts performance.\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of the aligned representation, we choose 2D and\n3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) as our evaluation tasks. In our evaluation, with\na simple 3D human pose decoder, UniHPR achieves remarkable performance metrics:\nMPJPE 49.9mm on the Human3.6M dataset and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on the 3DPW dataset\nwith cross-domain evaluation.

To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce\nadditional data for further training or incorporate external or internal\ninformation during inference. However, these approaches inevitably introduce\nextra computational costs. In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in\nMLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual\ntokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the\nmodel's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As\na result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn\nexacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we\npropose \\textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that\nleverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical\nvisual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To the best of our\nknowledge, we are the first to apply token pruning for hallucination mitigation\nin MLLMs. Notably, our method don't require additional training and incurs\nnearly no extra inference cost. Moreover, PruneHal is model-agnostic and can be\nseamlessly integrated with different decoding strategies, including those\nspecifically designed for hallucination mitigation. We evaluate PruneHal on\nseveral widely used hallucination evaluation benchmarks using four mainstream\nMLLMs, achieving robust and outstanding results that highlight the\neffectiveness and superiority of our method.

To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce\nadditional data for further training or incorporate external or internal\ninformation during inference.

In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in\nMLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual\ntokens.

Earth Observation (EO) represents a\nquintessential domain for multi-modal data analysis, wherein diverse remote\nsensors collect data to sense our planet. This unprecedented volume of data\nintroduces novel challenges. Specifically, the access to the same sensor\nmodalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex\nbased on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms. In this\ncontext, multi-modal co-learning presents a promising strategy to leverage the\nvast amount of sensor-derived data available at the training stage to improve\nsingle-modality models for inference-time deployment. Most current research\nefforts focus on designing customized solutions for either particular\ndownstream tasks or specific modalities available at the inference stage. To\naddress this, we propose a novel multi-modal co-learning framework capable of\ngeneralizing across various tasks without targeting a specific modality for\ninference.

Across home,\noffice, and clinic deployments, CoSense-LLM delivers grounded explanations\nwhile meeting tight service level objectives: it sustains sub second (p95) end\nto end latency on edge dominant paths, reduces inter tier token and bandwidth\ncosts by preferring local retrieval grounded responses, and preserves privacy\nby transmitting only discrete codes and redacted metadata. Ablations show that\nEdge-RAG improves factual consistency and reduces contradictions, calibrated\nuncertainty enables selective abstention and controlled escalations, and KV\nplus decoding accelerators lower energy per decision. The results support an\nedge first design that treats semantics, privacy, and predictable latency as co\nequal goals for large model deployments in interference prone environments."}

We\nintegrate it into CycleGAN and UNSB as two representative backbones.\nComprehensive evaluation across three imaging modalities: optical coherence\ntomography angiography, color fundus and X-ray coronary angiography\ndemonstrates that CST improves translation fidelity and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance. By reinforcing geometric integrity in learned\nmappings, CST establishes a principled pathway toward curvilinear\nstructure-aware cross-domain translation in medical imaging."}

OmniMotion-X efficiently\nsupports diverse multimodal tasks, including text-to-motion, music-to-dance,\nspeech-to-gesture, and global spatial-temporal control scenarios (e.g., motion\nprediction, in-betweening, completion, and joint/trajectory-guided synthesis),\nas well as flexible combinations of these tasks. Specifically, we propose the\nuse of reference motion as a novel conditioning signal, substantially enhancing\nthe consistency of generated content, style, and temporal dynamics crucial for\nrealistic animations. To handle multimodal conflicts, we introduce a\nprogressive weak-to-strong mixed-condition training strategy. To enable\nhigh-quality multimodal training, we construct OmniMoCap-X, the largest unified\nmultimodal motion dataset to date, integrating 28 publicly available MoCap\nsources across 10 distinct tasks, standardized to the SMPL-X format at 30 fps.\nTo ensure detailed and consistent annotations, we render sequences into videos\nand use GPT-4o to automatically generate structured and hierarchical captions,\ncapturing both low-level actions and high-level semantics. Extensive\nexperimental evaluations confirm that OmniMotion-X significantly surpasses\nexisting methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across multiple\nmultimodal tasks and enabling the interactive generation of realistic,\ncoherent, and controllable long-duration motions."}

To address\nthis, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods update models using unlabeled target\ndata. However, existing approaches often ignore two key challenges: prototype\ndegradation in long-tailed distributions and confusion between semantically\nsimilar classes. To tackle these issues, we propose \\textbf{C}lass-Aware\n\\textbf{P}rototype \\textbf{L}earning with \\textbf{N}egative\n\\textbf{C}ontrast(\\textbf{CPL-NC}), a lightweight TTA framework designed\nspecifically for VLMs to enhance generalization under distribution shifts.\nCPL-NC introduces a \\textit{Class-Aware Prototype Cache} Module that\ndynamically adjusts per-class capacity based on test-time frequency and\nactivation history, with a rejuvenation mechanism for inactive classes to\nretain rare-category knowledge. Additionally, a \\textit{Negative Contrastive\nLearning} Mechanism identifies and constrains hard visual-textual negatives to\nimprove class separability. The framework employs asymmetric optimization,\nrefining only textual prototypes while anchoring on stable visual features.\nExperiments on 15 benchmarks show that CPL-NC consistently outperforms prior\nTTA methods across both ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 backbones."}

However, the research community's progress remains constrained\nby the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets\nbuilt from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive\n400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is\nconstructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real\nphotographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K\nfrom previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and\ndiversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure\ncomprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content\npreservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring\nand careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables\nresearch into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized\nsubsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential\nediting, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a\n56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training;\nand (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction\nrewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale,\nhigh-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust\nfoundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided\nimage editing models."}
