However, current training pipelines primarily\nrely on high-level vision-sound-text pairs and lack fine-grained, structured\nalignment between pixel-level visual content and textual semantics. To overcome\nthis challenge, we propose ESCA, a new framework for contextualizing embodied\nagents through structured spatial-temporal understanding. At its core is\nSGClip, a novel CLIP-based, open-domain, and promptable model for generating\nscene graphs. SGClip is trained on 87K+ open-domain videos via a neurosymbolic\nlearning pipeline, which harnesses model-driven self-supervision from\nvideo-caption pairs and structured reasoning, thereby eliminating the need for\nhuman-labeled scene graph annotations. We demonstrate that SGClip supports both\nprompt-based inference and task-specific fine-tuning, excelling in scene graph\ngeneration and action localization benchmarks.

Their linear complexity and hidden-state\nrecurrence make them particularly attractive for modeling long sequences,\nwhereas attention becomes quadratically expensive.

Consequently, these models\nsuffer from degraded performance when evaluated on videos with spatial and\ntemporal resolutions unseen during training; a property we call spatio-temporal\ninflexibility.

We evaluate six LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-Chat-V3,\nGemini-2.5-Flash, Claude-3.5-Haiku, Llama-4-Maverick) under five prompt types\n(zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), CoT-few-shot, self-reflection)\nacross relevance classification and six Level-2 tasks, using accuracy,\nprecision, recall, and F1. Results show pronounced model-prompt interaction\neffects: CoT-few-shot yields the most reliable precision-recall balance;\nzero-shot maximizes recall for high-sensitivity passes; and self-reflection\nunderperforms due to over-inclusivity and instability across models. GPT-4o and\nDeepSeek provide robust overall performance, while GPT-4o-mini performs\ncompetitively at a substantially lower dollar cost. A cost-performance analysis\nfor relevance classification (per 1,000 abstracts) reveals large absolute\ndifferences among model-prompt pairings; GPT-4o-mini remains low-cost across\nprompts, and structured prompts (CoT/CoT-few-shot) on GPT-4o-mini offer\nattractive F1 at a small incremental cost. We recommend a staged workflow that\n(1) deploys low-cost models with structured prompts for first-pass screening\nand (2) escalates only borderline cases to higher-capacity models. These\nfindings highlight LLMs' uneven but promising potential to automate literature\nscreening.

This shortcoming is largely due to the tendency of the text encoder\nto focus on individual words rather than their relations, a limitation\nreinforced by contrastive training that primarily aligns words with visual\nobjects. In this paper, we introduce REconstruction and Alignment of text\nDescriptions (READ), a fine-tuning method designed to enhance compositional\nreasoning by adding two auxiliary objectives to the contrastive learning: (1) a\ntoken-level reconstruction objective, where a frozen pre-trained decoder\nreconstructs alternative captions based on the embedding of the original\ncaption; and (2) a sentence-level alignment objective, which explicitly aligns\nparaphrased sentences in the embedding space. We show that READ-CLIP, a model\nderived by applying the READ method to the pre-trained CLIP model, achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance across five major compositional reasoning\nbenchmarks, outperforming the strongest conventional fine-tuning baseline by up\nto 4.1%. Furthermore, applying the READ to existing CLIP variants (including\nNegCLIP and FSC-CLIP) also improves performance on these benchmarks.\nQuantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that our proposed objectives --\nreconstruction and alignment -- offer complementary benefits: the former\nencourages the encoder to capture relationships between words within a caption,\nwhile the latter ensures consistent representations for paraphrases expressed\nwith different wording."}

This is the camera-ready version", "summary": "Despite recent advances, vision-language models trained with standard\ncontrastive objectives still struggle with compositional reasoning -- the\nability to understand structured relationships between visual and linguistic\nelements. This shortcoming is largely due to the tendency of the text encoder\nto focus on individual words rather than their relations, a limitation\nreinforced by contrastive training that primarily aligns words with visual\nobjects. In this paper, we introduce REconstruction and Alignment of text\nDescriptions (READ), a fine-tuning method designed to enhance compositional\nreasoning by adding two auxiliary objectives to the contrastive learning: (1) a\ntoken-level reconstruction objective, where a frozen pre-trained decoder\nreconstructs alternative captions based on the embedding of the original\ncaption; and (2) a sentence-level alignment objective, which explicitly aligns\nparaphrased sentences in the embedding space. We show that READ-CLIP, a model\nderived by applying the READ method to the pre-trained CLIP model, achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance across five major compositional reasoning\nbenchmarks, outperforming the strongest conventional fine-tuning baseline by up\nto 4.1%. Furthermore, applying the READ to existing CLIP variants (including\nNegCLIP and FSC-CLIP) also improves performance on these benchmarks.\nQuantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that our proposed objectives --\nreconstruction and alignment -- offer complementary benefits: the former\nencourages the encoder to capture relationships between words within a caption,\nwhile the latter ensures consistent representations for paraphrases expressed\nwith different wording."}

PIF then\nlearns the photographic style of reference images with the textual inversion\ntechnique, by optimizing the prompts for the photographic concepts.

Guided by the \"less\nis more\" philosophy, we demonstrate that the orchestration of five simple\nelement achieves superior performance in a standard reconstruction-based\nframework. This methodological minimalism enables natural extension across\ndiverse tasks without modification, establishing that simplicity is the\nfoundation of true universality. Extensive experiments on 12 UAD benchmarks\ndemonstrate Dinomaly2's full-spectrum superiority across multiple modalities\n(2D, multi-view, RGB-3D, RGB-IR), task settings (single-class, multi-class,\ninference-unified multi-class, few-shot) and application domains (industrial,\nbiological, outdoor). For example, our multi-class model achieves unprecedented\n99.9% and 99.3% image-level (I-) AUROC on MVTec-AD and VisA respectively. For\nmulti-view and multi-modal inspection, Dinomaly2 demonstrates state-of-the-art\nperformance with minimum adaptations. Moreover, using only 8 normal examples\nper class, our method surpasses previous full-shot models, achieving 98.7% and\n97.4% I-AUROC on MVTec-AD and VisA. The combination of minimalistic design,\ncomputational scalability, and universal applicability positions Dinomaly2 as a\nunified solution for the full spectrum of real-world anomaly detection\napplications."}

Inspired by these critical\nproblems, we propose an intelligent communication mixture-of-experts\nboosted-medical image segmentation foundation model, named IC-MoE, with twofold\nideas: 1) We construct basic experts, semantic experts, and adaptive experts.\nMoreover, we implement a pixel probability adaptive voting strategy, which\nenables expert selection and fusion through label consistency and load\nbalancing.
