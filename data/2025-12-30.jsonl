We introduce VISTA (Visual-Information Separation for Text-based Analysis), a modular framework that decouples perception from reasoning via an explicit information bottleneck. A frozen VLM sensor is restricted to short, objective perception queries, while a text-only LLM reasoner decomposes each question, plans queries, and aggregates visual facts in natural language. This controlled interface defines a reward-aligned environment for training unbiased visual reasoning with reinforcement learning. Instantiated with Qwen2.5-VL and Llama3.2-Vision sensors, and trained with GRPO from only 641 curated multi-step questions, VISTA significantly improves robustness to real-world spurious correlations on SpuriVerse (+16.29% with Qwen-2.5-VL-7B and +6.77% with Llama-3.2-Vision-11B), while remaining competitive on MMVP and a balanced SeedBench subset. VISTA transfers robustly across unseen VLM sensors and is able to recognize and recover from VLM perception failures. Human analysis further shows that VISTA's reasoning traces are more neutral, less reliant on spurious attributes, and more explicitly grounded in visual evidence than end-to-end VLM baselines."}

We introduce SAMM2D, a dual-encoder framework that achieves an AUC of 0.686 on the RSNA intracranial aneurysm dataset; an improvement of 32% over the clinical baseline. In a comprehensive ablation across six augmentation regimes, we made a striking discovery: any form of data augmentation degraded performance when coupled with a strong pretrained backbone. Our unaugmented baseline model outperformed all augmented variants by 1.75--2.23 percentage points (p < 0.01), overturning the assumption that \"more augmentation is always better\" in low-data medical settings. We hypothesize that ImageNet-pretrained features already capture robust invariances, rendering additional augmentations both redundant and disruptive to the learned feature manifold. By calibrating the decision threshold, SAMM2D reaches 95% sensitivity, surpassing average radiologist performance, and translates to a projected \\$13.9M in savings per 1,000 patients in screening applications.

However, traditional MIL approaches often lose crucial contextual information, while transformer-based variants, though more expressive, suffer from quadratic complexity and redundant computations. To address these limitations, we propose HookMIL, a context-aware and computationally efficient MIL framework that leverages compact, learnable hook tokens for structured contextual aggregation. These tokens can be initialized from (i) key-patch visual features, (ii) text embeddings from vision-language pathology models, and (iii) spatially grounded features from spatial transcriptomics-vision models. This multimodal initialization enables Hook Tokens to incorporate rich textual and spatial priors, accelerating convergence and enhancing representation quality. During training, Hook tokens interact with instances through bidirectional attention with linear complexity. To further promote specialization, we introduce a Hook Diversity Loss that encourages each token to focus on distinct histopathological patterns. Additionally, a hook-to-hook communication mechanism refines contextual interactions while minimizing redundancy.

We first replicate TinySAM on COCO val2017 using official checkpoints, matching the reported AP within 0.03%, establishing a reliable experimental baseline. Building on this, we propose Tiny-YOLOSAM, a fast hybrid pipeline that uses a recent YOLO detector (YOLOv12) to generate box prompts for TinySAM on salient foreground objects, and supplements uncovered regions with sparse point prompts sampled only where YOLO-guided masks provide no coverage. On COCO val2017, the hybrid system substantially improves class-agnostic coverage (AR from 16.4% to 77.1%, mIoU from 19.2% to 67.8%) while reducing end-to-end runtime from 49.20s/image to 10.39s/image (4.7x) on an Apple M1 Pro CPU.

Spatial reasoning is a key component of human intelligence, but most existing benchmarks focus on static images or final outputs, failing to account for the sequential and viewpoint-dependent nature of this skill. To close this gap, we introduce GamiBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial reasoning and 2D-to-3D planning in MLLMs through origami-inspired folding tasks. GamiBench includes 186 regular and 186 impossible 2D crease patterns paired with their corresponding 3D folded shapes, produced from six distinct viewpoints across three visual question-answering (VQA) tasks: predicting 3D fold configurations, distinguishing valid viewpoints, and detecting impossible patterns.

It further introduces new diagnostic metrics--viewpoint consistency (VC) and impossible fold selection rate (IFSR)--to measure how well models handle folds of varying complexity.

Limited access to physicians often leaves DR undiagnosed. To address this, AI models utilize lesion segmentation for interpretability; however, manually annotating lesions is impractical for clinicians. Physicians require a model that explains the reasoning for classifications rather than just highlighting lesion locations. Furthermore, current models are one-dimensional, relying on a single imaging modality for explainability and achieving limited effectiveness. In contrast, a quantitative-detection system that identifies individual DR lesions in natural language would overcome these limitations, enabling diverse applications in screening, treatment, and research settings. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel multimodal explainability model utilizing a VLM with few-shot learning, which mimics an ophthalmologist's reasoning by analyzing lesion distributions within retinal quadrants for fundus images. The model generates paired Grad-CAM heatmaps, showcasing individual neuron weights across both OCT and fundus images, which visually highlight the regions contributing to DR severity classification.

In this paper, we propose Gamma, a novel foundation model that introduces multi-head geometric attention to knowledge graph reasoning. Gamma replaces the single relational transformation with multiple parallel ones, including real, complex, split-complex, and dual number based transformations, each designed to model different relational structures.

Recent research on autonomous agents has increasingly focused on designing efficient memory workflows by drawing on cognitive neuroscience. However, constrained by interdisciplinary barriers, existing works struggle to assimilate the essence of human memory mechanisms. To bridge this gap, we systematically synthesizes interdisciplinary knowledge of memory, connecting insights from cognitive neuroscience with LLM-driven agents. Specifically, we first elucidate the definition and function of memory along a progressive trajectory from cognitive neuroscience through LLMs to agents. We then provide a comparative analysis of memory taxonomy, storage mechanisms, and the complete management lifecycle from both biological and artificial perspectives. Subsequently, we review the mainstream benchmarks for evaluating agent memory. Additionally, we explore memory security from dual perspectives of attack and defense. Finally, we envision future research directions, with a focus on multimodal memory systems and skill acquisition."}

Existing approaches, including large vision language models (LVLMs) and deep multimodal fusion methods, often fall short due to limited reasoning and shallow evidence utilization. A key bottleneck is the lack of dedicated datasets that provide complete real-world multimodal misinformation instances accompanied by annotated reasoning processes and verifiable evidence. To address this limitation, we introduce RW-Post, a high-quality and explainable dataset for real-world multimodal fact-checking. RW-Post aligns real-world multimodal claims with their original social media posts, preserving the rich contextual information in which the claims are made. In addition, the dataset includes detailed reasoning and explicitly linked evidence, which are derived from human written fact-checking articles via a large language model assisted extraction pipeline, enabling comprehensive verification and explanation. Building upon RW-Post, we propose AgentFact, an agent-based multimodal fact-checking framework designed to emulate the human verification workflow. AgentFact consists of five specialized agents that collaboratively handle key fact-checking subtasks, including strategy planning, high-quality evidence retrieval, visual analysis, reasoning, and explanation generation. These agents are orchestrated through an iterative workflow that alternates between evidence searching and task-aware evidence filtering and reasoning, facilitating strategic decision-making and systematic evidence analysis. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the synergy between RW-Post and AgentFact substantially improves both the accuracy and interpretability of multimodal fact-checking."}

This reflects a broader semantic gap between human perception and current generative models. We investigate whether geometric understanding can be introduced without specialized training by using lightweight, off-the-shelf discriminators as external guidance signals. We propose a Human Perception Embedding (HPE) teacher trained on the THINGS triplet dataset, which captures human sensitivity to object shape. By injecting gradients from this teacher into the latent diffusion process, we show that geometry and style can be separated in a controllable manner. We evaluate this approach across three architectures: Stable Diffusion v1.5 with a U-Net backbone, the flow-matching model SiT-XL/2, and the diffusion transformer PixArt-Σ. Our experiments reveal that flow models tend to drift back toward their default trajectories without continuous guidance, and we demonstrate zero-shot transfer of complex three-dimensional shapes, such as an Eames chair, onto conflicting materials such as pink metal. This guided generation improves semantic alignment by about 80 percent compared to unguided baselines. Overall, our results show that small teacher models can reliably guide large generative systems, enabling stronger geometric control and broadening the creative range of text-to-image synthesis."}

This is especially problematic in K--12 settings, which the EU AI Act classifies as high-risk domain requiring responsible design. Motivated by these concerns, this study synthesises evidence on limitations of LLM-based tutors and empirically investigates one critical issue: the accuracy, reliability, and temporal coherence of assessing learners' evolving knowledge over time. We compare a deep knowledge tracing (DKT) model with a widely used LLM, evaluated zero-shot and fine-tuned, using a large open-access dataset. Results show that DKT achieves the highest discrimination performance (AUC = 0.83) on next-step correctness prediction and consistently outperforms the LLM across settings. Although fine-tuning improves the LLM's AUC by approximately 8\\% over the zero-shot baseline, it remains 6\\% below DKT and produces higher early-sequence errors, where incorrect predictions are most harmful for adaptive support. Temporal analyses further reveal that DKT maintains stable, directionally correct mastery updates, whereas LLM variants exhibit substantial temporal weaknesses, including inconsistent and wrong-direction updates. These limitations persist despite the fine-tuned LLM requiring nearly 198 hours of high-compute training, far exceeding the computational demands of DKT. Our qualitative analysis of multi-skill mastery estimation further shows that, even after fine-tuning, the LLM produced inconsistent mastery trajectories, while DKT maintained smooth and coherent updates. Overall, the findings suggest that LLMs alone are unlikely to match the effectiveness of established intelligent tutoring systems, and that responsible tutoring requires hybrid frameworks that incorporate learner modelling."}

Current benchmarks, typically based on medical licensing exams or curated vignettes, fail to capture the integrated, multimodal reasoning essential for real-world patient care. Methods: We developed the Bones and Joints (B&J) Benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation framework comprising 1,245 questions derived from real-world patient cases in orthopedics and sports medicine. This benchmark assesses models across 7 tasks that mirror the clinical reasoning pathway, including knowledge recall, text and image interpretation, diagnosis generation, treatment planning, and rationale provision. We evaluated eleven vision-language models (VLMs) and six large language models (LLMs), comparing their performance against expert-derived ground truth. Results: Our results demonstrate a pronounced performance gap between task types. While state-of-the-art models achieved high accuracy, exceeding 90%, on structured multiple-choice questions, their performance markedly declined on open-ended tasks requiring multimodal integration, with accuracy scarcely reaching 60%. VLMs demonstrated substantial limitations in interpreting medical images and frequently exhibited severe text-driven hallucinations, often ignoring contradictory visual evidence. Notably, models specifically fine-tuned for medical applications showed no consistent advantage over general-purpose counterparts. Conclusions: Current artificial intelligence models are not yet clinically competent for complex, multimodal reasoning. Their safe deployment should currently be limited to supportive, text-based roles. Future advancement in core clinical tasks awaits fundamental breakthroughs in multimodal integration and visual understanding."}

This study quantitatively demonstrates that LVLMs' instruction-following ability declines after fine-tuning and analyzes its underlying causes. In particular, we constructed new training datasets highlighting whether the output format is specified. Then, we investigated how explicitly indicating the output format during fine-tuning affects LVLMs' instruction-following ability. Our quantitative evaluation confirmed that LVLMs' instruction-following ability declines after fine-tuning with commonly used datasets. Furthermore, we found that LVLMs trained with datasets, including instructions on output format, tend to follow instructions more accurately than models that do not.

Evaluations on CheXpert and NIH benchmarks reveal a fundamental tension: GRPO recovers in-distribution performance (23% improvement on CheXpert, macro-F1 = 0.346) but degrades cross-dataset transferability (19% drop on NIH). This mirrors high-resource models like NV-Reason-CXR-3B, suggesting the issue stems from the RL paradigm rather than scale. We identify a generalization paradox where the SFT checkpoint uniquely improves on NIH before optimization, indicating teacher-guided reasoning captures more institution-agnostic features.

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are particularly promising for ultrasound interpretation, as they can jointly process images and text to perform multiple clinical tasks within a single framework. However, despite the expansion of VLMs, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate their performance in fetal ultrasound imaging. This gap is primarily due to the modality's challenging nature, operator dependency, and the limited public availability of datasets. To address this gap, we present Fetal-Gauge, the first and largest visual question answering benchmark specifically designed to evaluate VLMs across various fetal ultrasound tasks. Our benchmark comprises over 42,000 images and 93,000 question-answer pairs, spanning anatomical plane identification, visual grounding of anatomical structures, fetal orientation assessment, clinical view conformity, and clinical diagnosis. We systematically evaluate several state-of-the-art VLMs, including general-purpose and medical-specific models, and reveal a substantial performance gap: the best-performing model achieves only 55\\% accuracy, far below clinical requirements. Our analysis identifies critical limitations of current VLMs in fetal ultrasound interpretation, highlighting the urgent need for domain-adapted architectures and specialized training approaches.

A frozen VLM sensor is restricted to short, objective perception queries, while a text-only LLM reasoner decomposes each question, plans queries, and aggregates visual facts in natural language. This controlled interface defines a reward-aligned environment for training unbiased visual reasoning with reinforcement learning.

Thermal comfort, a sophisticated interplay of environmental factors and personal perceptions involving sensory integration and adaptive decision-making, serves as an ideal paradigm for evaluating real-world cognitive capabilities of AI systems. To address this, we propose TCEval, the first evaluation framework that assesses three core cognitive capacities of AI, cross-modal reasoning, causal association, and adaptive decision-making, by leveraging thermal comfort scenarios and large language model (LLM) agents. The methodology involves initializing LLM agents with virtual personality attributes, guiding them to generate clothing insulation selections and thermal comfort feedback, and validating outputs against the ASHRAE Global Database and Chinese Thermal Comfort Database. Experiments on four LLMs show that while agent feedback has limited exact alignment with humans, directional consistency improves significantly with a 1 PMV tolerance. Statistical tests reveal that LLM-generated PMV distributions diverge markedly from human data, and agents perform near-randomly in discrete thermal comfort classification. These results confirm the feasibility of TCEval as an ecologically valid Cognitive Turing Test for AI, demonstrating that current LLMs possess foundational cross-modal reasoning ability but lack precise causal understanding of the nonlinear relationships between variables in thermal comfort. TCEval complements traditional benchmarks, shifting AI evaluation focus from abstract task proficiency to embodied, context-aware perception and decision-making, offering valuable insights for advancing AI in human-centric applications like smart buildings."}

We present VideoScaffold, a dynamic representation framework designed for streaming video understanding. It adaptively adjusts event granularity according to video duration while preserving fine-grained visual semantics. VideoScaffold introduces two key components: Elastic-Scale Event Segmentation (EES), which performs prediction-guided segmentation to dynamically refine event boundaries, and Hierarchical Event Consolidation (HEC), which progressively aggregates semantically related segments into multi-level abstractions. Working in concert, EES and HEC enable VideoScaffold to transition smoothly from fine-grained frame understanding to abstract event reasoning as the video stream unfolds. Extensive experiments across both offline and streaming video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that VideoScaffold achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Recent benchmarks show that even frontier vision-language models achieve only 50-53% accuracy on basic quantitative physics tasks, behaving as approximate guessers that preserve semantic plausibility while violating physical constraints. This input unfaithfulness is not a scaling deficiency but a structural limitation. Perception-centric architectures optimize parameter-space imitation, whereas safety-critical control demands outcome-space guarantees over executed actions. Here, we present a fundamentally different pathway toward domain-specific foundation models by introducing compact language models operating as Agentic Physical AI, in which policy optimization is driven by physics-based validation rather than perceptual inference. We train a 360-million-parameter model on synthetic reactor control scenarios, scaling the dataset from 10^3 to 10^5 examples. This induces a sharp phase transition absent in general-purpose models. Small-scale systems exhibit high-variance imitation with catastrophic tail risk, while large-scale models undergo variance collapse exceeding 500x reduction, stabilizing execution-level behavior. Despite balanced exposure to four actuation families, the model autonomously rejects approximately 70% of the training distribution and concentrates 95% of runtime execution on a single-bank strategy.

MindWatcher can autonomously decide whether and how to invoke diverse tools and coordinate their use, without relying on human prompts or workflows.

To overcome these limitations, we propose VideoZoomer, a novel agentic framework that enables MLLMs to dynamically control their visual focus during reasoning. Starting from a coarse low-frame-rate overview, VideoZoomer invokes a temporal zoom tool to obtain high-frame-rate clips at autonomously chosen moments, thereby progressively gathering fine-grained evidence in a multi-turn interactive manner.

Dream-VLA achieves top-tier performance of 97.2% average success rate on LIBERO, 71.4% overall average on SimplerEnv-Bridge, and 60.5% overall average on SimplerEnv-Fractal, surpassing leading models such as $π_0$ and GR00T-N1. We also validate that dVLMs surpass AR baselines on downstream tasks across different training objectives. We release both Dream-VL and Dream-VLA to facilitate further research in the community."}

The growing complexity of LLMs, multimodal architectures, and recommendation systems, combined with techniques like sparsity and quantization, creates significant computational challenges.

However, manual optimization cannot keep pace with these demands, creating a critical bottleneck in AI system development. Recent advances in LLM code generation capabilities have opened new possibilities for automating kernel development. In this work, we propose AKG kernel agent (AI-driven Kernel Generator), a multi-agent system that automates kernel generation, migration, and performance tuning. AKG kernel agent is designed to support multiple domain-specific languages (DSLs), including Triton, TileLang, CPP, and CUDA-C, enabling it to target different hardware backends while maintaining correctness and portability. The system's modular design allows rapid integration of new DSLs and hardware targets.

To address this limitation, we introduce RW-Post, a high-quality and explainable dataset for real-world multimodal fact-checking. RW-Post aligns real-world multimodal claims with their original social media posts, preserving the rich contextual information in which the claims are made. In addition, the dataset includes detailed reasoning and explicitly linked evidence, which are derived from human written fact-checking articles via a large language model assisted extraction pipeline, enabling comprehensive verification and explanation. Building upon RW-Post, we propose AgentFact, an agent-based multimodal fact-checking framework designed to emulate the human verification workflow. AgentFact consists of five specialized agents that collaboratively handle key fact-checking subtasks, including strategy planning, high-quality evidence retrieval, visual analysis, reasoning, and explanation generation. These agents are orchestrated through an iterative workflow that alternates between evidence searching and task-aware evidence filtering and reasoning, facilitating strategic decision-making and systematic evidence analysis.

This shifts the interaction from brittle raw code manipulation to more robust, function-level updates. Second, we augment the MLLM's 3D scene understanding with a suite of specialized visual tools to analyze scene state, gather spatial information, and validate action outcomes. This perceptual feedback loop is critical for closing the gap between language-based updates and precise 3D-aware manipulation. Third, to manage the iterative, error-prone updates, we propose a collaborative multi-agent framework with designated roles for planning, execution, and verification.

These tokens can be initialized from (i) key-patch visual features, (ii) text embeddings from vision-language pathology models, and (iii) spatially grounded features from spatial transcriptomics-vision models. This multimodal initialization enables Hook Tokens to incorporate rich textual and spatial priors, accelerating convergence and enhancing representation quality. During training, Hook tokens interact with instances through bidirectional attention with linear complexity. To further promote specialization, we introduce a Hook Diversity Loss that encourages each token to focus on distinct histopathological patterns.

Unlike traditional diffusion or flow models, it does not rely solely on local supervision, which typically necessitates many inference steps. Unlike distillation-based approaches, it does not require a pretrained teacher. This combination of instantaneous local learning and self-driven global matching bridges the gap between the two paradigms, enabling the training of a high-quality text-to-image model from scratch that excels even at very low step counts. Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image benchmarks show that Self-E not only excels in few-step generation, but is also competitive with state-of-the-art Flow Matching models at 50 steps.

Current benchmarks, typically based on medical licensing exams or curated vignettes, fail to capture the integrated, multimodal reasoning essential for real-world patient care. Methods: We developed the Bones and Joints (B&J) Benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation framework comprising 1,245 questions derived from real-world patient cases in orthopedics and sports medicine. This benchmark assesses models across 7 tasks that mirror the clinical reasoning pathway, including knowledge recall, text and image interpretation, diagnosis generation, treatment planning, and rationale provision. We evaluated eleven vision-language models (VLMs) and six large language models (LLMs), comparing their performance against expert-derived ground truth. Results: Our results demonstrate a pronounced performance gap between task types. While state-of-the-art models achieved high accuracy, exceeding 90%, on structured multiple-choice questions, their performance markedly declined on open-ended tasks requiring multimodal integration, with accuracy scarcely reaching 60%. VLMs demonstrated substantial limitations in interpreting medical images and frequently exhibited severe text-driven hallucinations, often ignoring contradictory visual evidence. Notably, models specifically fine-tuned for medical applications showed no consistent advantage over general-purpose counterparts. Conclusions: Current artificial intelligence models are not yet clinically competent for complex, multimodal reasoning. Their safe deployment should currently be limited to supportive, text-based roles. Future advancement in core clinical tasks awaits fundamental breakthroughs in multimodal integration and visual understanding."}

To overcome these limitations, we propose VideoZoomer, a novel agentic framework that enables MLLMs to dynamically control their visual focus during reasoning.

We introduce DreamOmni3, tackling two challenges: data creation and framework design. Our data synthesis pipeline includes two parts: scribble-based editing and generation. For scribble-based editing, we define four tasks: scribble and instruction-based editing, scribble and multimodal instruction-based editing, image fusion, and doodle editing.

For scribble-based generation, we define three tasks: scribble and instruction-based generation, scribble and multimodal instruction-based generation, and doodle generation, following similar data creation pipelines. For the framework, instead of using binary masks, which struggle with complex edits involving multiple scribbles, images, and instructions, we propose a joint input scheme that feeds both the original and scribbled source images into the model, using different colors to distinguish regions and simplify processing. By applying the same index and position encodings to both images, the model can precisely localize scribbled regions while maintaining accurate editing.

In this paper, we bridge this critical gap by tackling three key challenges in 3D object arrangement task using MLLMs. First, to address the weak visual grounding of MLLMs, which struggle to link programmatic edits with precise 3D outcomes, we introduce an MCP-based API. This shifts the interaction from brittle raw code manipulation to more robust, function-level updates. Second, we augment the MLLM's 3D scene understanding with a suite of specialized visual tools to analyze scene state, gather spatial information, and validate action outcomes. This perceptual feedback loop is critical for closing the gap between language-based updates and precise 3D-aware manipulation. Third, to manage the iterative, error-prone updates, we propose a collaborative multi-agent framework with designated roles for planning, execution, and verification. This decomposition allows the system to robustly handle multi-step instructions and recover from intermediate errors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a diverse set of 25 complex object arrangement tasks, where it significantly outperforms existing baselines. Website: vulcan-3d.github.io"}

However, most existing 3D segmentation frameworks rely exclusively on visual learning from large annotated datasets restricting their adaptability to new domains and clinical tasks. The lack of semantic understanding in these models makes them ineffective in addressing flexible, user-defined segmentation objectives. To overcome these limitations, we propose SwinTF3D, a lightweight multimodal fusion approach that unifies visual and linguistic representations for text-guided 3D medical image segmentation. The model employs a transformer-based visual encoder to extract volumetric features and integrates them with a compact text encoder via an efficient fusion mechanism. This design allows the system to understand natural-language prompts and correctly align semantic cues with their corresponding spatial structures in medical volumes, while producing accurate, context-aware segmentation results with low computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the BTCV dataset demonstrate that SwinTF3D achieves competitive Dice and IoU scores across multiple organs, despite its compact architecture. The model generalizes well to unseen data and offers significant efficiency gains compared to conventional transformer-based segmentation networks. Bridging visual perception with linguistic understanding, SwinTF3D establishes a practical and interpretable paradigm for interactive, text-driven 3D medical image segmentation, opening perspectives for more adaptive and resource-efficient solutions in clinical imaging."}

However, existing methods often overlook scenarios involving long context inputs with multiple images. In this paper, we analyze the challenges of visual token pruning in long context, multi-image settings and introduce an adaptive pruning method tailored for such scenarios. We decompose redundancy into intra-image and inter-image components and quantify them through intra-image diversity and inter-image variation, which jointly guide dynamic budget allocation. Our approach consists of two stages. The intra-image stage allocates each image a content-aware token budget and greedily selects its most representative tokens. The inter-image stage performs global diversity filtering to form a candidate pool and then applies a Pareto selection procedure that balances diversity with text alignment. Extensive experiments show that our approach maintains strong performance in long context settings while significantly cutting down the number of visual tokens."}

Although effective, we observe that such similarity distributions across grades usually exhibit multimodal patterns. For instance, an image embedding may show high similarity to both \"excellent\" and \"poor\" grade descriptions while deviating from the \"good\" one. We refer to this phenomenon as \"semantic drift\", where semantic inconsistencies between text embeddings and their intended descriptions undermine the reliability of text-image shared-space learning. To mitigate this issue, we draw inspiration from psychometrics and propose an improved Graded Response Model (GRM) for AGIQA. The GRM is a classical assessment model that categorizes a subject's ability across grades using test items with various difficulty levels. This paradigm aligns remarkably well with human quality rating, where image quality can be interpreted as an image's ability to meet various quality grades. Building on this philosophy, we design a two-branch quality grading module: one branch estimates image ability while the other constructs multiple difficulty levels. To ensure monotonicity in difficulty levels, we further model difficulty generation in an arithmetic manner, which inherently enforces a unimodal and interpretable quality distribution. Our Arithmetic GRM based Quality Grading (AGQG) module enjoys a plug-and-play advantage, consistently improving performance when integrated into various state-of-the-art AGIQA frameworks. Moreover, it also generalizes effectively to both natural and screen content image quality assessment, revealing its potential as a key component in future IQA models."}

LENS first constructs a large-scale dataset by transforming Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) responses related to depression and anxiety symptoms into natural-language descriptions, yielding over 100,000 sensor-text QA pairs from 258 participants. To enable native time-series integration, we train a patch-level encoder that projects raw sensor signals directly into an LLM's representation space.

Existing solver-based acceleration methods often face significant image quality degradation under a low-latency budget, primarily due to accumulated truncation errors arising from the inability to capture high-curvature trajectory segments. In this paper, we propose the Ensemble Parallel Direction solver (dubbed as EPD-Solver), a novel ODE solver that mitigates these errors by incorporating multiple parallel gradient evaluations in each step. Motivated by the geometric insight that sampling trajectories are largely confined to a low-dimensional manifold, EPD-Solver leverages the Mean Value Theorem for vector-valued functions to approximate the integral solution more accurately. Importantly, since the additional gradient computations are independent, they can be fully parallelized, preserving low-latency sampling nature. We introduce a two-stage optimization framework. Initially, EPD-Solver optimizes a small set of learnable parameters via a distillation-based approach. We further propose a parameter-efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL) fine-tuning scheme that reformulates the solver as a stochastic Dirichlet policy. Unlike traditional methods that fine-tune the massive backbone, our RL approach operates strictly within the low-dimensional solver space, effectively mitigating reward hacking while enhancing performance in complex text-to-image (T2I) generation tasks. In addition, our method is flexible and can serve as a plugin (EPD-Plugin) to improve existing ODE samplers."}

Due to the scarcity of real defect images, unsupervised approaches that rely solely on normal images have been extensively studied. Recently, diffusion-based generative models brought attention to training data synthesis as an alternative solution. In this work, we focus on a strategy to effectively leverage synthetic images to maximize the anomaly detection performance. Previous synthesis strategies are broadly categorized into two groups, presenting a clear trade-off. Rule-based synthesis, such as injecting noise or pasting patches, is cost-effective but often fails to produce realistic defect images. On the other hand, generative model-based synthesis can create high-quality defect images but requires substantial cost. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained text-guided image-to-image translation model and image retrieval model to efficiently generate synthetic defect images. Specifically, the image retrieval model assesses the similarity of the generated images to real normal images and filters out irrelevant outputs, thereby enhancing the quality and relevance of the generated defect images. To effectively leverage synthetic images, we also introduce a two stage training strategy. In this strategy, the model is first pre-trained on a large volume of images from rule-based synthesis and then fine-tuned on a smaller set of high-quality images. This method significantly reduces the cost for data collection while improving the anomaly detection performance. Experiments on the MVTec AD dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."}

Traditional methods are computationally expensive and prone to structural discontinuities and loss of detail in sparse slices, making it difficult to meet clinical accuracy requirements.To address these challenges, we propose an efficient 3D reconstruction method based on 3D Gaussian and tri-plane representations. This method not only maintains the advantages of Gaussian representation in efficient rendering and geometric representation but also significantly enhances structural continuity and semantic consistency under sparse slicing conditions. Experimental results on multimodal medical datasets such as US and MRI show that our proposed method can generate high-quality, anatomically coherent, and semantically stable medical images under sparse data conditions, while significantly improving reconstruction efficiency. This provides an efficient and reliable new approach for 3D visualization and clinical analysis of medical images."}

Although recent multimodal and vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches enhance semantic understanding of change regions by incorporating textual descriptions, they still suffer from challenges such as inaccurate spatial localization, imprecise pixel-level boundary delineation, and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose ViLaCD-R1, a two-stage framework comprising a Multi-Image Reasoner (MIR) and a Mask-Guided Decoder (MGD). Specifically, the VLM is trained through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) on block-level dual-temporal inference tasks, taking dual-temporal image patches as input and outputting a coarse change mask. Then, the decoder integrates dual-temporal image features with this coarse mask to predict a precise binary change map.

However, while extensively studied in indoor settings, its zero-shot generalization to open-world domains lags far behind perspective images, which benefit from abundant training data. This disparity makes transferring capabilities from the perspective domain an attractive solution. To bridge this gap, we present Depth Anything in $360^\\circ$ (DA360), a panoramic-adapted version of Depth Anything V2. Our key innovation involves learning a shift parameter from the ViT backbone, transforming the model's scale- and shift-invariant output into a scale-invariant estimate that directly yields well-formed 3D point clouds. This is complemented by integrating circular padding into the DPT decoder to eliminate seam artifacts, ensuring spatially coherent depth maps that respect spherical continuity. Evaluated on standard indoor benchmarks and our newly curated outdoor dataset, Metropolis, DA360 shows substantial gains over its base model, achieving over 50\\% and 10\\% relative depth error reduction on indoor and outdoor benchmarks, respectively. Furthermore, DA360 significantly outperforms robust panoramic depth estimation methods, achieving about 30\\% relative error improvement compared to PanDA across all three test datasets and establishing new state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot panoramic depth estimation."}

However, existing approaches primarily focus on erasing concepts from text prompts, overlooking other input modalities that are increasingly critical in real-world applications such as image editing and personalized generation. These modalities can become attack surfaces, where erased concepts re-emerge despite defenses. To bridge this gap, we introduce M-ErasureBench, a novel multimodal evaluation framework that systematically benchmarks concept erasure methods across three input modalities: text prompts, learned embeddings, and inverted latents. For the latter two, we evaluate both white-box and black-box access, yielding five evaluation scenarios. Our analysis shows that existing methods achieve strong erasure performance against text prompts but largely fail under learned embeddings and inverted latents, with Concept Reproduction Rate (CRR) exceeding 90% in the white-box setting. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose IRECE (Inference-time Robustness Enhancement for Concept Erasure), a plug-and-play module that localizes target concepts via cross-attention and perturbs the associated latents during denoising. Experiments demonstrate that IRECE consistently restores robustness, reducing CRR by up to 40% under the most challenging white-box latent inversion scenario, while preserving visual quality. To the best of our knowledge, M-ErasureBench provides the first comprehensive benchmark of concept erasure beyond text prompts. Together with IRECE, our benchmark offers practical safeguards for building more reliable protective generative models."}

We propose \\textbf{CoFi-Dec}, a training-free decoding framework that mitigates hallucinations by integrating generative self-feedback with coarse-to-fine visual conditioning. Inspired by the human visual process from global scene perception to detailed inspection, CoFi-Dec first generates two intermediate textual responses conditioned on coarse- and fine-grained views of the original image. These responses are then transformed into synthetic images using a text-to-image model, forming multi-level visual hypotheses that enrich grounding cues. To unify the predictions from these multiple visual conditions, we introduce a Wasserstein-based fusion mechanism that aligns their predictive distributions into a geometrically consistent decoding trajectory. This principled fusion reconciles high-level semantic consistency with fine-grained visual grounding, leading to more robust and faithful outputs. Extensive experiments on six hallucination-focused benchmarks show that CoFi-Dec substantially reduces both entity-level and semantic-level hallucinations, outperforming existing decoding strategies. The framework is model-agnostic, requires no additional training, and can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of LVLMs. The implementation is available at https://github.com/AI-Researcher-Team/CoFi-Dec."}

The lack of semantic understanding in these models makes them ineffective in addressing flexible, user-defined segmentation objectives. To overcome these limitations, we propose SwinTF3D, a lightweight multimodal fusion approach that unifies visual and linguistic representations for text-guided 3D medical image segmentation. The model employs a transformer-based visual encoder to extract volumetric features and integrates them with a compact text encoder via an efficient fusion mechanism. This design allows the system to understand natural-language prompts and correctly align semantic cues with their corresponding spatial structures in medical volumes, while producing accurate, context-aware segmentation results with low computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the BTCV dataset demonstrate that SwinTF3D achieves competitive Dice and IoU scores across multiple organs, despite its compact architecture. The model generalizes well to unseen data and offers significant efficiency gains compared to conventional transformer-based segmentation networks. Bridging visual perception with linguistic understanding, SwinTF3D establishes a practical and interpretable paradigm for interactive, text-driven 3D medical image segmentation, opening perspectives for more adaptive and resource-efficient solutions in clinical imaging."}

In contrast, most computational object recognition systems operate on isolated image regions, devoid of meaning in isolation, thus ignoring this vital contextual information. This paper argues for the critical role of context and introduces a novel framework for contextual object classification. We first construct a Geo-Semantic Contextual Graph (GSCG) from a single monocular image. This rich, structured representation is built by integrating a metric depth estimator with a unified panoptic and material segmentation model. The GSCG encodes objects as nodes with detailed geometric, chromatic, and material attributes, and their spatial relationships as edges. This explicit graph structure makes the model's reasoning process inherently interpretable. We then propose a specialized graph-based classifier that aggregates features from a target object, its immediate neighbors, and the global scene context to predict its class. Through extensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that our context-aware model achieves a classification accuracy of 73.4%, dramatically outperforming context-agnostic versions (as low as 38.4%). Furthermore, our GSCG-based approach significantly surpasses strong baselines, including fine-tuned ResNet models (max 53.5%) and a state-of-the-art multimodal Large Language Model (LLM), Llama 4 Scout, which, even when given the full image alongside a detailed description of objects, maxes out at 42.3%. These results on COCO 2017 train/val splits highlight the superiority of explicitly structured and interpretable context for object recognition tasks."}

We first summarize the shared multimodal foundation (visual tokenization, Transformer attention, and instruction following), then describe each architecture at a level sufficient to justify engineering choices without speculative internals. Finally, we connect model behavior to system constraints: structured outputs can be syntactically valid while semantically incorrect, schema validation is structural (not geometric correctness), person identifiers are frame-local in the current prompting contract, and interactive single-frame analysis returns free-form text rather than schema-enforced JSON.

They fail to evaluate agentic video research, which necessitates actively interrogating video timelines, cross-referencing dispersed evidence, and verifying claims against the open web. To bridge this gap, we present \\textbf{Video-BrowseComp}, a challenging benchmark comprising 210 questions tailored for open-web agentic video reasoning.

However, learning-based models are widely believed to be sensitive to domain shift, with robustness typically pursued through large and diverse training datasets, without explaining the underlying mechanisms. In this work, we show that domain-shift immunity is an inherent property of deep deformable registration models, arising from their reliance on local feature representations rather than global appearance for deformation estimation. To isolate and validate this mechanism, we introduce UniReg, a universal registration framework that decouples feature extraction from deformation estimation using fixed, pre-trained feature extractors and a UNet-based deformation network. Despite training on a single dataset, UniReg exhibits robust cross-domain and multi-modal performance comparable to optimization-based methods. Our analysis further reveals that failures of conventional CNN-based models under modality shift originate from dataset-induced biases in early convolutional layers. These findings identify local feature consistency as the key driver of robustness in learning-based deformable registration and motivate backbone designs that preserve domain-invariant local features."}

To address these limitations, we propose a novel unified DWM framework based on 3D Gaussian scene representation, which enables both 3D scene understanding and multi-modal scene generation, while also enabling contextual enrichment for understanding and generation tasks. Our approach directly aligns textual information with the 3D scene by embedding rich linguistic features into each Gaussian primitive, thereby achieving early modality alignment.

MM-UAVBench comprises 19 sub-tasks with over 5.7K manually annotated questions, all derived from real-world UAV data collected from public datasets.

Due to the scarcity of real defect images, unsupervised approaches that rely solely on normal images have been extensively studied. Recently, diffusion-based generative models brought attention to training data synthesis as an alternative solution. In this work, we focus on a strategy to effectively leverage synthetic images to maximize the anomaly detection performance. Previous synthesis strategies are broadly categorized into two groups, presenting a clear trade-off. Rule-based synthesis, such as injecting noise or pasting patches, is cost-effective but often fails to produce realistic defect images. On the other hand, generative model-based synthesis can create high-quality defect images but requires substantial cost. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained text-guided image-to-image translation model and image retrieval model to efficiently generate synthetic defect images. Specifically, the image retrieval model assesses the similarity of the generated images to real normal images and filters out irrelevant outputs, thereby enhancing the quality and relevance of the generated defect images. To effectively leverage synthetic images, we also introduce a two stage training strategy. In this strategy, the model is first pre-trained on a large volume of images from rule-based synthesis and then fine-tuned on a smaller set of high-quality images. This method significantly reduces the cost for data collection while improving the anomaly detection performance. Experiments on the MVTec AD dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."}

To address the deficiencies of existing methods, including the failure of fixed resolutions to balance efficiency and detail, as well as the lack of semantic hierarchy in single-scale alignment, this study proposes a Vision-language Model (VLM) framework integrated with two key innovations: the Dynamic Resolution Input Strategy (DRIS) and the Multi-scale Vision-language Alignment Mechanism (MS-VLAM).Specifically, the DRIS adopts a coarse-to-fine approach to adaptively allocate computational resources according to the complexity of image content, thereby preserving key fine-grained features while reducing redundant computational overhead. The MS-VLAM constructs a three-tier alignment mechanism covering object, local-region and global levels, which systematically captures cross-modal semantic consistency and alleviates issues of semantic misalignment and granularity imbalance.Experimental results on the RS-GPT4V dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the accuracy of semantic understanding and computational efficiency in tasks including image captioning and cross-modal retrieval. Compared with conventional methods, it achieves superior performance in evaluation metrics such as BLEU-4 and CIDEr for image captioning, as well as R@10 for cross-modal retrieval. This technical framework provides a novel approach for constructing efficient and robust multimodal remote sensing systems, laying a theoretical foundation and offering technical guidance for the engineering application of intelligent remote sensing interpretation."}

Although recent multimodal and vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches enhance semantic understanding of change regions by incorporating textual descriptions, they still suffer from challenges such as inaccurate spatial localization, imprecise pixel-level boundary delineation, and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose ViLaCD-R1, a two-stage framework comprising a Multi-Image Reasoner (MIR) and a Mask-Guided Decoder (MGD). Specifically, the VLM is trained through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) on block-level dual-temporal inference tasks, taking dual-temporal image patches as input and outputting a coarse change mask. Then, the decoder integrates dual-temporal image features with this coarse mask to predict a precise binary change map. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple RSCD benchmarks demonstrate that ViLaCD-R1 substantially improves true semantic change recognition and localization, robustly suppresses non-semantic variations, and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in complex real-world scenarios."}

Furthermore, based on our analysis of padding embeddings in FLUX, we propose a semantic control strategy that repurposes padding embeddings as semantic containers. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive feature-sharing strategy that automatically evaluates textual ambiguity and applies constraints only to the ambiguous identity prompt.

We begin from a single hypothesis: that visual understanding presupposes a semantic language for vision, in which many perceptual observations correspond to a small number of discrete semantic states. Together with widely assumed premises on transferability and abstraction in representation learning, this hypothesis implies that the visual observation space must be organized in a fiber bundle like structure, where nuisance variation populates fibers and semantics correspond to a quotient base space. From this structure we derive two theoretical consequences. First, the semantic quotient $X/G$ is not a submanifold of $X$ and cannot be obtained through smooth deformation alone, semantic invariance requires a non-homeomorphic, discriminative target, for example, supervision via labels, cross instance identification, or multimodal alignment that supplies explicit semantic equivalence. Second, we show that approximating the quotient also places structural demands on the model architecture. Semantic abstraction requires not only an external semantic target, but a representation mechanism capable of supporting topology change: an expand-and-snap process in which the manifold is first geometrically expanded to separate structure and then collapsed to form discrete semantic regions. We emphasize that these results are interpretive rather than prescriptive: the framework provides a topological lens that aligns with empirical regularities observed in large-scale discriminative and multimodal models, and with classical principles in statistical learning theory."}

However, its inherently complex nature, spanning visual perception, cognition, and emotion, poses fundamental challenges. Although aesthetic descriptions offer a viable representation of this complexity, two critical challenges persist: (1) data scarcity and imbalance: existing dataset overly focuses on visual perception and neglects deeper dimensions due to the expensive manual annotation; and (2) model fragmentation: current visual networks isolate aesthetic attributes with multi-branch encoder, while multimodal methods represented by contrastive learning struggle to effectively process long-form textual descriptions. To resolve challenge (1), we first present the Refined Aesthetic Description (RAD) dataset, a large-scale (70k), multi-dimensional structured dataset, generated via an iterative pipeline without heavy annotation costs and easy to scale. To address challenge (2), we propose ArtQuant, an aesthetics assessment framework for artistic images which not only couples isolated aesthetic dimensions through joint description generation, but also better models long-text semantics with the help of LLM decoders. Besides, theoretical analysis confirms this symbiosis: RAD's semantic adequacy (data) and generation paradigm (model) collectively minimize prediction entropy, providing mathematical grounding for the framework.

Unlike prior methods that operate solely on final samples, DDSPO provides dense, transition-level signals across the denoising trajectory. In practice, we avoid reliance on labeled data by automatically generating preference signals using a pretrained reference model: we contrast its outputs when conditioned on original prompts versus semantically degraded variants. This practical strategy enables effective score-space preference supervision without explicit reward modeling or manual annotations.

This work investigates whether uncertainty quantification can mitigate such challenges and enhance model generalisability in a domain-agnostic manner. To this end, we (1) curate UncertSAM, a benchmark comprising eight datasets designed to stress-test SAM under challenging segmentation conditions including shadows, transparency, and camouflage; (2) evaluate a suite of lightweight, post-hoc uncertainty estimation methods; and (3) assess a preliminary uncertainty-guided prediction refinement step. Among evaluated approaches, a last-layer Laplace approximation yields uncertainty estimates that correlate well with segmentation errors, indicating a meaningful signal. While refinement benefits are preliminary, our findings underscore the potential of incorporating uncertainty into segmentation models to support robust, domain-agnostic performance.

However, they still tend to produce hallucinated content that is inconsistent with the visual input, which limits their reliability in real-world applications. We propose \\textbf{CoFi-Dec}, a training-free decoding framework that mitigates hallucinations by integrating generative self-feedback with coarse-to-fine visual conditioning. Inspired by the human visual process from global scene perception to detailed inspection, CoFi-Dec first generates two intermediate textual responses conditioned on coarse- and fine-grained views of the original image. These responses are then transformed into synthetic images using a text-to-image model, forming multi-level visual hypotheses that enrich grounding cues. To unify the predictions from these multiple visual conditions, we introduce a Wasserstein-based fusion mechanism that aligns their predictive distributions into a geometrically consistent decoding trajectory. This principled fusion reconciles high-level semantic consistency with fine-grained visual grounding, leading to more robust and faithful outputs. Extensive experiments on six hallucination-focused benchmarks show that CoFi-Dec substantially reduces both entity-level and semantic-level hallucinations, outperforming existing decoding strategies. The framework is model-agnostic, requires no additional training, and can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of LVLMs. The implementation is available at https://github.com/AI-Researcher-Team/CoFi-Dec."}

The methodology involves sequential stages of image preprocessing, annotation, waterline detection, scale gap estimation, and numeric reading extraction.

Nonetheless, when confronted with lengthy videos, these models struggle: their temporal windows are narrow, and they fail to notice fine-grained semantic shifts that unfold over extended durations. Moreover, mainstream text-based retrieval pipelines, which rely chiefly on surface-level lexical overlap, ignore the rich temporal interdependence among visual, audio, and subtitle channels. To mitigate these limitations, we propose TV-RAG, a training-free architecture that couples temporal alignment with entropy-guided semantics to improve long-video reasoning. The framework contributes two main mechanisms: \\emph{(i)} a time-decay retrieval module that injects explicit temporal offsets into the similarity computation, thereby ranking text queries according to their true multimedia context; and \\emph{(ii)} an entropy-weighted key-frame sampler that selects evenly spaced, information-dense frames, reducing redundancy while preserving representativeness. By weaving these temporal and semantic signals together, TV-RAG realises a dual-level reasoning routine that can be grafted onto any LVLM without re-training or fine-tuning. The resulting system offers a lightweight, budget-friendly upgrade path and consistently surpasses most leading baselines across established long-video benchmarks such as Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench, confirming the effectiveness of our model.

We propose PathFound, an agentic multimodal model designed to support evidence-seeking inference in pathological diagnosis. PathFound integrates the power of pathological visual foundation models, vision-language models, and reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning to perform proactive information acquisition and diagnosis refinement by progressing through the initial diagnosis, evidence-seeking, and final decision stages. Across several large multimodal models, adopting this strategy consistently improves diagnostic accuracy, indicating the effectiveness of evidence-seeking workflows in computational pathology. Among these models, PathFound achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance across diverse clinical scenarios and demonstrates strong potential to discover subtle details, such as nuclear features and local invasions."}

Traditional safety methods like text blacklisting or harmful content classification have significant drawbacks: they can be easily circumvented or require extensive datasets and extra training. To overcome these challenges, we introduce PurifyGen, a novel, training-free approach for safe T2I generation that retains the model's original weights. PurifyGen introduces a dual-stage strategy for prompt purification. First, we evaluate the safety of each token in a prompt by computing its complementary semantic distance, which measures the semantic proximity between the prompt tokens and concept embeddings from predefined toxic and clean lists. This enables fine-grained prompt classification without explicit keyword matching or retraining. Tokens closer to toxic concepts are flagged as risky. Second, for risky prompts, we apply a dual-space transformation: we project toxic-aligned embeddings into the null space of the toxic concept matrix, effectively removing harmful semantic components, and simultaneously align them into the range space of clean concepts. This dual alignment purifies risky prompts by both subtracting unsafe semantics and reinforcing safe ones, while retaining the original intent and coherence. We further define a token-wise strategy to selectively replace only risky token embeddings, ensuring minimal disruption to safe content. PurifyGen offers a plug-and-play solution with theoretical grounding and strong generalization to unseen prompts and models. Extensive testing shows that PurifyGen surpasses current methods in reducing unsafe content across five datasets and competes well with training-dependent approaches.

We first construct a modality-balanced dataset of 87K samples, each annotated with both binary safety labels and risk categories under a hierarchical multimodal safety taxonomy, effectively mitigating modality bias and ensuring consistent moderation across text, image, and text-image inputs. Based on this dataset, we train our vision-language base model purely through reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve efficient and concise reasoning. To approximate proactive safety scenarios in a controlled setting, we further introduce an OOD safety category inference task and augment the RL objective with a synonym-bank-based similarity reward that encourages the model to generate concise descriptions for unseen unsafe categories. Experimental results show that ProGuard achieves performance comparable to closed-source large models on binary safety classification, substantially outperforms existing open-source guard models on unsafe content categorization. Most notably, ProGuard delivers a strong proactive moderation ability, improving OOD risk detection by 52.6% and OOD risk description by 64.8%."}

However, the simultaneous denoising of all video frames with bidirectional attention via an iterative process in diffusion models prevents real-time interaction. While existing distillation methods can make the model autoregressive and reduce sampling steps to mitigate this, they focus primarily on text-to-video generation, leaving the human-AI interaction unnatural and less efficient. This paper targets real-time interactive video diffusion conditioned on a multimodal context, including text, image, and audio, to bridge the gap. Given the observation that the leading on-policy distillation approach Self Forcing encounters challenges (visual artifacts like flickering, black frames, and quality degradation) with multimodal conditioning, we investigate an improved distillation recipe with emphasis on the quality of condition inputs as well as the initialization and schedule for the on-policy optimization. On benchmarks for multimodal-conditioned (audio, image, and text) avatar video generation including HDTF, AVSpeech, and CelebV-HQ, our distilled model matches the visual quality of the full-step, bidirectional baselines of similar or larger size with 20x less inference cost and latency. Further, we integrate our model with audio language models and long-form video inference technique Anchor-Heavy Identity Sinks to build LiveTalk, a real-time multimodal interactive avatar system. System-level evaluation on our curated multi-turn interaction benchmark shows LiveTalk outperforms state-of-the-art models (Sora2, Veo3) in multi-turn video coherence and content quality, while reducing response latency from 1 to 2 minutes to real-time generation, enabling seamless human-AI multimodal interaction."}

The dataset spans a diverse range of everyday objects across contexts, viewpoints, and appearances. Fine-tuning VLMs on TWIN yields notable gains in fine-grained recognition, even on unseen domains such as art, animals, plants, and landmarks. To quantify these gains, we introduce FGVQA, a benchmark suite of 12,000 queries that repurposes fine-grained recognition and retrieval datasets from multiple domains. While existing VLMs struggle on FGVQA, when fine-tuned on TWIN they improve by up to 19.3%, without compromising performance on general VQA benchmarks.

These complexities require to be addressed with an effective and scalable system that can assist in enhancing the salience of the subtle visual cues and provide a high level of the generalization on the multimodal imaging data. A Scalable Residual Feature Aggregation (SRFA) framework is proposed to be used to meet these conditions in this study. The framework integrates a pipeline of preprocessing followed by the segmentation using the MAGRes-UNet that is effective in making the pancreatic structures and isolating regions of interest more visible. DenseNet-121 performed with residual feature storage is used to extract features to allow deep hierarchical features to be aggregated without properties loss. To go further, hybrid HHO-BA metaheuristic feature selection strategy is used, which guarantees the best feature subset refinement. To be classified, the system is trained based on a new hybrid model that integrates the ability to pay attention on the world, which is the Vision Transformer (ViT) with the high representational efficiency of EfficientNet-B3. A dual optimization mechanism incorporating SSA and GWO is used to fine-tune hyperparameters to enhance greater robustness and less overfitting.

Our key observation is that modern video diffusion models already synthesize convincing transparent phenomena, suggesting they have internalized the optical rules. We build TransPhy3D, a synthetic video corpus of transparent/reflective scenes: 11k sequences rendered with Blender/Cycles. Scenes are assembled from a curated bank of category-rich static assets and shape-rich procedural assets paired with glass/plastic/metal materials. We render RGB + depth + normals with physically based ray tracing and OptiX denoising. Starting from a large video diffusion model, we learn a video-to-video translator for depth (and normals) via lightweight LoRA adapters. During training we concatenate RGB and (noisy) depth latents in the DiT backbone and co-train on TransPhy3D and existing frame-wise synthetic datasets, yielding temporally consistent predictions for arbitrary-length input videos. The resulting model, DKT, achieves zero-shot SOTA on real and synthetic video benchmarks involving transparency: ClearPose, DREDS (CatKnown/CatNovel), and TransPhy3D-Test. It improves accuracy and temporal consistency over strong image/video baselines, and a normal variant sets the best video normal estimation results on ClearPose. A compact 1.3B version runs at ~0.17 s/frame. Integrated into a grasping stack, DKT's depth boosts success rates across translucent, reflective and diffuse surfaces, outperforming prior estimators.

However, it has been observed that LVLMs, after tuning to visual instruction using commonly used training datasets, often fail to exhibit the instruction-following ability that was present in the LLM before integration, leading to results in which they do not follow task instructions as expected. This study quantitatively demonstrates that LVLMs' instruction-following ability declines after fine-tuning and analyzes its underlying causes. In particular, we constructed new training datasets highlighting whether the output format is specified. Then, we investigated how explicitly indicating the output format during fine-tuning affects LVLMs' instruction-following ability. Our quantitative evaluation confirmed that LVLMs' instruction-following ability declines after fine-tuning with commonly used datasets. Furthermore, we found that LVLMs trained with datasets, including instructions on output format, tend to follow instructions more accurately than models that do not. These findings suggest that including samples with instructions on output format during (visual) instruction tuning may help mitigate the decline in instruction-following abilities."}
