This work investigates bias propagation and robustness degradation in state-of-the-art vision-language and generative models, with a particular focus on image rotation and distributional shifts. We analyze how rotation-induced perturbations affect model predictions, confidence calibration, and demographic bias patterns. To address these issues, we propose rotation-robust mitigation strategies that combine data augmentation, representation alignment, and model-level regularization. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly improve robustness while reducing bias amplification without sacrificing overall performance. This study highlights critical limitations of current multimodal systems and provides practical mitigation techniques for building more reliable and fair AI models."}

Accepted for publication by the 14th international conference on Computational Visual Media (CVM 2026)", "summary": "Audio-visual embodied navigation aims to enable an agent to autonomously localize and reach a sound source in unseen 3D environments by leveraging auditory cues. The key challenge of this task lies in effectively modeling the interaction between heterogeneous features during multimodal fusion, so as to avoid single-modality dominance or information degradation, particularly in cross-domain scenarios. To address this, we propose a Cross-Modal Residual Fusion Network, which introduces bidirectional residual interactions between audio and visual streams to achieve complementary modeling and fine-grained alignment, while maintaining the independence of their representations. Unlike conventional methods that rely on simple concatenation or attention gating, CRFN explicitly models cross-modal interactions via residual connections and incorporates stabilization techniques to improve convergence and robustness. Experiments on the Replica and Matterport3D datasets demonstrate that CRFN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fusion baselines and achieves stronger cross-domain generalization. Notably, our experiments also reveal that agents exhibit differentiated modality dependence across different datasets. The discovery of this phenomenon provides a new perspective for understanding the cross-modal collaboration mechanism of embodied agents."}

To achieve this, the study first develops a multimodal fusion method combining thermal imaging and LiDAR, enabling precise calibration and synchronization of multimodal data streams to create accurate representations of temperature distributions in buildings. Second, it integrates this fusion approach with LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO), enabling full coverage of large-scale structures and allowing for detailed monitoring of temperature variations and defect detection across inspection cycles. Experimental validations, including case studies on a bridge and a hall building, demonstrate that Thermo-LIO can detect detailed thermal anomalies and structural defects more accurately than traditional methods. The system enhances diagnostic precision, enables real-time processing, and expands inspection coverage, highlighting the crucial role of multimodal sensor integration in advancing SHM methodologies for large-scale civil infrastructure."}

Traditional VLN often follows a close-set assumption, i.e., training and test data share the same style of the input images and instructions. However, the real world is open and filled with various unseen environments, posing enormous difficulties for close-set methods. To this end, we focus on the General Scene Adaptation (GSA-VLN) task, aiming to learn generalized navigation ability by introducing diverse environments and inconsistent intructions.Towards this task, when facing unseen environments and instructions, the challenge mainly lies in how to enable the agent to dynamically produce generalized strategies during the navigation process. Recent research indicates that by means of fast and slow cognition systems, human beings could generate stable policies, which strengthen their adaptation for open world. Inspired by this idea, we propose the slow4fast-VLN, establishing a dynamic interactive fast-slow reasoning framework. The fast-reasoning module, an end-to-end strategy network, outputs actions via real-time input. It accumulates execution records in a history repository to build memory. The slow-reasoning module analyze the memories generated by the fast-reasoning module. Through deep reflection, it extracts experiences that enhance the generalization ability of decision-making. These experiences are structurally stored and used to continuously optimize the fast-reasoning module. Unlike traditional methods that treat fast-slow reasoning as independent mechanisms, our framework enables fast-slow interaction. By leveraging the experiences from slow reasoning. This interaction allows the system to continuously adapt and efficiently execute navigation tasks when facing unseen scenarios."}

Yet conventional Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions in aviation remain siloed and narrow, focusing on isolated tasks or single modalities.

This paper introduces the vision of AviationLMM, a Large Multimodal foundation Model for civil aviation, designed to unify the heterogeneous data streams of civil aviation and enable understanding, reasoning, generation and agentic applications. We firstly identify the gaps between existing AI solutions and requirements. Secondly, we describe the model architecture that ingests multimodal inputs such as air-ground voice, surveillance, on-board telemetry, video and structured texts, and performs cross-modal alignment and fusion, and produces flexible outputs ranging from situation summaries and risk alerts to predictive diagnostics and multimodal incident reconstructions.

The prevailing \"restoration-then-recognition\" two-stage paradigm suffers from a fundamental flaw: the pixel-level optimization objectives of image restoration models are misaligned with the semantic goals of character recognition, leading to artifact interference and error accumulation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated powerful general capabilities, they lack explicit structural modeling for license plate character sequences (e.g., fixed length, specific order). To address this, we propose an end-to-end structure-aware multimodal reasoning framework based on Qwen3-VL. The core innovation lies in the Character-Aware Multimodal Reasoning Module (CMRM), which introduces a set of learnable Character Slot Queries. Through a cross-attention mechanism, these queries actively retrieve fine-grained evidence corresponding to character positions from visual features. Subsequently, we inject these character-aware representations back into the visual tokens via residual modulation, enabling the language model to perform autoregressive generation based on explicit structural priors. Furthermore, combined with the LoRA parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, the model achieves domain adaptation while retaining the generalization capabilities of the large model. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world severely degraded datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing restoration-recognition combinations and general VLMs, validating the superiority of incorporating structured reasoning into large models for low-quality text recognition tasks."}

This mapping is naturally formulated as an Extreme Multi-Label Classification (XMLC) problem, but supervised solutions are constrained by the scarcity and cost of large-scale, taxonomy-aligned annotations--especially in non-English settings where job-ad language diverges substantially from formal skill definitions. We propose a zero-shot skill extraction framework that eliminates the need for manually labeled job-ad training data. The framework uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to synthesize training instances from ESCO definitions, and introduces hierarchically constrained multi-skill generation based on ESCO Level-2 categories to improve semantic coherence in multi-label contexts. On top of the synthetic corpus, we train a contrastive bi-encoder that aligns job-ad sentences with ESCO skill descriptions in a shared embedding space; the encoder augments a BERT backbone with BiLSTM and attention pooling to better model long, information-dense requirement statements. An upstream RoBERTa-based binary filter removes non-skill sentences to improve end-to-end precision. Experiments show that (i) hierarchy-conditioned generation improves both fluency and discriminability relative to unconstrained pairing, and (ii) the resulting multi-label model transfers effectively to real-world Chinese job advertisements, achieving strong zero-shot retrieval performance (F1@5 = 0.72) and outperforming TF--IDF and standard BERT baselines. Overall, the proposed pipeline provides a scalable, data-efficient pathway for automated skill coding in labor economics and workforce analytics."}

This survey presents a comprehensive and structured synthesis of memory in LLMs and MLLMs, organizing the literature into a cohesive taxonomy comprising implicit, explicit, and agentic memory paradigms. Specifically, the survey delineates three primary memory frameworks. Implicit memory refers to the knowledge embedded within the internal parameters of pre-trained transformers, encompassing their capacity for memorization, associative retrieval, and contextual reasoning. Recent work has explored methods to interpret, manipulate, and reconfigure this latent memory. Explicit memory involves external storage and retrieval components designed to augment model outputs with dynamic, queryable knowledge representations, such as textual corpora, dense vectors, and graph-based structures, thereby enabling scalable and updatable interaction with information sources. Agentic memory introduces persistent, temporally extended memory structures within autonomous agents, facilitating long-term planning, self-consistency, and collaborative behavior in multi-agent systems, with relevance to embodied and interactive AI. Extending beyond text, the survey examines the integration of memory within multi-modal settings, where coherence across vision, language, audio, and action modalities is essential. Key architectural advances, benchmark tasks, and open challenges are discussed, including issues related to memory capacity, alignment, factual consistency, and cross-system interoperability."}

Full fine-tuning is often computationally and energy intensive, which can be prohibitive for smaller institutions and non-profit organizations in the Web4Good ecosystem. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), especially Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), reduces this cost by updating only a small number of parameters. We show that the standard LoRA update $ΔW = BA^\\top$ has geometric drawbacks: gauge freedom, scale ambiguity, and a tendency toward rank collapse. We introduce OrthoGeoLoRA, which enforces an SVD-like form $ΔW = BΣA^\\top$ by constraining the low-rank factors to be orthogonal (Stiefel manifold). A geometric reparameterization implements this constraint while remaining compatible with standard optimizers such as Adam and existing fine-tuning pipelines. We also propose a benchmark for hierarchical concept retrieval over the European Language Social Science Thesaurus (ELSST), widely used to organize social science resources in digital repositories. Experiments with a multilingual sentence encoder show that OrthoGeoLoRA outperforms standard LoRA and several strong PEFT variants on ranking metrics under the same low-rank budget, offering a more compute- and parameter-efficient path to adapt foundation models in resource-constrained settings."}

RISER constructs a library of reusable reasoning vectors and employs a lightweight Router to dynamically compose them for each input. The Router is optimized via reinforcement learning under task-level rewards, activating latent cognitive primitives in an emergent and compositional manner. Across seven diverse benchmarks, RISER yields 3.4-6.5% average zero-shot accuracy improvements over the base model while surpassing CoT-style reasoning with 2-3x higher token efficiency and robust accuracy gains.

This network comprises two components: (i) a Syntactic Branch that extracts explicit grammatical dependencies from parse trees, and (ii) a Semantic Branch that models latent conceptual relations derived from BERT-based similarity graphs. BiAffine fusion module aligns syntactic and semantic units, while a differential regularizer disentangles embeddings to encourage complementary representations.

Early approaches focus on pure text-based reasoning. More recent studies have incorporated multimodal information into the reasoning steps; however, they often follow a single task-specific reasoning pattern, which limits their generalizability across various multimodal tasks. In fact, there are numerous multimodal tasks requiring diverse reasoning skills, such as zooming in on a specific region or marking an object within an image. To address this, we propose unified generative multimodal reasoning, which unifies diverse multimodal reasoning skills by generating intermediate images during the reasoning process. We instantiate this paradigm with Omni-R1, a two-stage SFT+RL framework featuring perception alignment loss and perception reward, thereby enabling functional image generation. Additionally, we introduce Omni-R1-Zero, which eliminates the need for multimodal annotations by bootstrapping step-wise visualizations from text-only reasoning data. Empirical results show that Omni-R1 achieves unified generative reasoning across a wide range of multimodal tasks, and Omni-R1-Zero can match or even surpass Omni-R1 on average, suggesting a promising direction for generative multimodal reasoning."}

We evaluated five widely used GenAI image platforms (Adobe Firefly, DALL-E 3, Google Imagen 3, Microsoft Image Generator, and Midjourney) using 30 architectural prompts spanning styles, typologies, and codified elements. Each prompt-generator pair produced four images (n = 600 images total). Two architectural historians independently scored each image for accuracy against predefined criteria, resolving disagreements by consensus. Set-level performance was summarized as zero to four accurate images per four-image set. Image output from Common prompts was 2.7-fold more accurate than from Rare prompts (p < 0.05). Across platforms, overall accuracy was limited (highest accuracy score 52 percent; lowest 32 percent; mean 42 percent). All-correct (4 out of 4) outcomes were similar across platforms. By contrast, all-incorrect (0 out of 4) outcomes varied substantially, with Imagen 3 exhibiting the fewest failures and Microsoft Image Generator exhibiting the highest number of failures. Qualitative review of the image dataset identified recurring patterns including over-embellishment, confusion between medieval styles and their later revivals, and misrepresentation of descriptive prompts (for example, egg-and-dart, banded column, pendentive). These findings support the need for visible labeling of GenAI synthetic content, provenance standards for future training datasets, and cautious educational use of GenAI architectural imagery."}

While high-capacity models achieve strong segmentation accuracy, their computational demands hinder practical deployment and long-term maintainability in hospital environments. We present a deployment-oriented framework that leverages knowledge distillation to translate a high-performing segmentation model into a scalable family of compact student models, without modifying the inference pipeline. The proposed approach preserves architectural compatibility with existing clinical systems while enabling systematic capacity reduction. The framework is evaluated on a multi-site brain MRI dataset comprising 1,104 3D volumes, with independent testing on 101 curated cases, and is further examined on abdominal CT to assess cross-modality generalizability. Under aggressive parameter reduction (94%), the distilled student model preserves nearly all of the teacher's segmentation accuracy (98.7%), while achieving substantial efficiency gains, including up to a 67% reduction in CPU inference latency without additional deployment overhead. These results demonstrate that knowledge distillation provides a practical and reliable pathway for converting research-grade segmentation models into maintainable, deployment-ready components for on-premises clinical workflows in real-world health systems."}

To facilitate this evaluation, we introduce the first English-Turkish parallel clinical RE dataset, derived and carefully curated from the 2010 i2b2/VA relation classification corpus. We systematically assess a diverse set of prompting strategies, including multiple in-context learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approaches, and compare their performance to fine-tuned baselines such as PURE.

Our results show that prompting-based LLM approaches consistently outperform traditional fine-tuned models. Moreover, evaluations for English performed better than their Turkish counterparts across all evaluated LLMs and prompting techniques. Among ICL methods, RAR achieves the highest performance, with Gemini 1.5 Flash reaching a micro-F1 score of 0.906 in English and 0.888 in Turkish. Performance further improves to 0.918 F1 in English when RAR is combined with a structured reasoning prompt using the DeepSeek-V3 model.

Accepted for publication by the 14th international conference on Computational Visual Media (CVM 2026)", "summary": "Audio-visual embodied navigation aims to enable an agent to autonomously localize and reach a sound source in unseen 3D environments by leveraging auditory cues. The key challenge of this task lies in effectively modeling the interaction between heterogeneous features during multimodal fusion, so as to avoid single-modality dominance or information degradation, particularly in cross-domain scenarios. To address this, we propose a Cross-Modal Residual Fusion Network, which introduces bidirectional residual interactions between audio and visual streams to achieve complementary modeling and fine-grained alignment, while maintaining the independence of their representations. Unlike conventional methods that rely on simple concatenation or attention gating, CRFN explicitly models cross-modal interactions via residual connections and incorporates stabilization techniques to improve convergence and robustness. Experiments on the Replica and Matterport3D datasets demonstrate that CRFN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fusion baselines and achieves stronger cross-domain generalization. Notably, our experiments also reveal that agents exhibit differentiated modality dependence across different datasets. The discovery of this phenomenon provides a new perspective for understanding the cross-modal collaboration mechanism of embodied agents."}

A key challenge is transferring knowledge from NBI to enhance WLI-only models, yet existing methods are critically hampered by their reliance on paired NBI-WLI images of the same lesion, a costly and often impractical requirement that leaves vast amounts of clinical data untapped. In this paper, we break this paradigm by introducing PaGKD, a novel Pairing-free Group-level Knowledge Distillation framework that that enables effective cross-modal learning using unpaired WLI and NBI data. Instead of forcing alignment between individual, often semantically mismatched image instances, PaGKD operates at the group level to distill more complete and compatible knowledge across modalities. Central to PaGKD are two complementary modules: (1) Group-level Prototype Distillation (GKD-Pro) distills compact group representations by extracting modality-invariant semantic prototypes via shared lesion-aware queries; (2) Group-level Dense Distillation (GKD-Den) performs dense cross-modal alignment by guiding group-aware attention with activation-derived relation maps. Together, these modules enforce global semantic consistency and local structural coherence without requiring image-level correspondence. Extensive experiments on four clinical datasets demonstrate that PaGKD consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving relative AUC improvements of 3.3%, 1.1%, 2.8%, and 3.2%, respectively, establishing a new direction for cross-modal learning from unpaired data."}

To address this gap, this work conducts a systematic investigation of PTQ under MXFP formats, encompassing over 7 PTQ algorithms, 15 evaluation benchmarks, and 3 LLM families. The key findings include: 1) MXFP8 consistently achieves near-lossless performance, while MXFP4 introduces substantial accuracy degradation and remains challenging; 2) PTQ effectiveness under MXFP depends strongly on format compatibility, with some algorithmic paradigms being consistently more effective than others; 3) PTQ performance exhibits highly consistent trends across model families and modalities, in particular, quantization sensitivity is dominated by the language model rather than the vision encoder in multimodal LLMs; 4) The scaling factor of quantization is a critical error source in MXFP4, and a simple pre-scale optimization strategy can significantly mitigate its impact. Together, these results provide practical guidance on adapting existing PTQ methods to MXFP quantization."}

An additional textual supervision with rich semantic information is explored to guide the disentanglement of object and non-object features. Specifically, we propose a Semantic Feature Alignment (SFA) module to align the object features with the corresponding text features. Furthermore, we develop an Object Feature Disentanglement (OFD) module that disentangles text-aligned object features and non-object features by minimizing their correlation. Finally, the disentangled object features are entered into the detection head. In this manner, the detection performance can be remarkably enhanced via more discriminative and less noisy features.

The prevailing \"restoration-then-recognition\" two-stage paradigm suffers from a fundamental flaw: the pixel-level optimization objectives of image restoration models are misaligned with the semantic goals of character recognition, leading to artifact interference and error accumulation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated powerful general capabilities, they lack explicit structural modeling for license plate character sequences (e.g., fixed length, specific order). To address this, we propose an end-to-end structure-aware multimodal reasoning framework based on Qwen3-VL. The core innovation lies in the Character-Aware Multimodal Reasoning Module (CMRM), which introduces a set of learnable Character Slot Queries. Through a cross-attention mechanism, these queries actively retrieve fine-grained evidence corresponding to character positions from visual features. Subsequently, we inject these character-aware representations back into the visual tokens via residual modulation, enabling the language model to perform autoregressive generation based on explicit structural priors. Furthermore, combined with the LoRA parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, the model achieves domain adaptation while retaining the generalization capabilities of the large model. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world severely degraded datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing restoration-recognition combinations and general VLMs, validating the superiority of incorporating structured reasoning into large models for low-quality text recognition tasks."}

In this paper, we challenge the assumption that parameter scaling is the only path to medical precision. We introduce SkinFlow, a framework that treats diagnosis as an optimization of visual information transmission efficiency. Our approach utilizes a Virtual-Width Dynamic Vision Encoder (DVE) to \"unfold\" complex pathological manifolds without physical parameter expansion, coupled with a two-stage Reinforcement Learning strategy. This strategy sequentially aligns explicit medical descriptions (Stage I) and reconstructs implicit diagnostic textures (Stage II) within a constrained semantic space. Furthermore, we propose a clinically grounded evaluation protocol that prioritizes diagnostic safety and hierarchical relevance over rigid label matching. Empirical results are compelling: our 7B model establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Fitzpatrick17k benchmark, achieving a +12.06% gain in Top-1 accuracy and a +28.57% boost in Top-6 accuracy over the massive general-purpose models (e.g., Qwen3VL-235B and GPT-5.2). These findings demonstrate that optimizing geometric capacity and information flow yields superior diagnostic reasoning compared to raw parameter scaling."}

However, the knowledge is not only hidden in the textual modality but also in the image modality. Traditional methods can parse text from domain documents but dont have image captioning ability. Multi-modal LLM (MLLM) can understand images, but they do not have sufficient domain knowledge. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a multi-stage progressive training strategy to train a Domain-specific Image Captioning Model (DICModel) in ICT, and constructs a standard evaluation system to validate the performance of DICModel. Specifically, this work first synthesizes about 7K image-text pairs by combining the Mermaid tool and LLMs, which are used for the first-stage supervised-fine-tuning (SFT) of DICModel. Then, ICT-domain experts manually annotate about 2K image-text pairs for the second-stage SFT of DICModel. Finally, experts and LLMs jointly synthesize about 1.5K visual question answering data for the instruction-based SFT. Experimental results indicate that our DICModel with only 7B parameters performs better than other state-of-the-art models with 32B parameters. Compared to the SOTA models with 7B and 32B parameters, our DICModel increases the BLEU metric by approximately 56.8% and 20.8%, respectively. On the objective questions constructed by ICT domain experts, our DICModel outperforms Qwen2.5-VL 32B by 1% in terms of accuracy rate. In summary, this work can efficiently and accurately extract the logical text from images, which is expected to promote the development of multimodal models in the ICT domain."}

Specifically, SSVP introduces the Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Synergy (HSVS) mechanism, which deeply integrates DINOv3's multi-scale structural priors into the CLIP semantic space. Subsequently, the Vision-Conditioned Prompt Generator (VCPG) employs cross-modal attention to guide dynamic prompt generation, enabling linguistic queries to precisely anchor to specific anomaly patterns. Furthermore, to address the discrepancy between global scoring and local evidence, the Visual-Text Anomaly Mapper (VTAM) establishes a dual-gated calibration paradigm.

We present SpikeVAEDiff, a novel two-stage framework that combines a Very Deep Variational Autoencoder (VDVAE) and the Versatile Diffusion model to generate high-resolution and semantically meaningful image reconstructions from neural spike data. In the first stage, VDVAE produces low-resolution preliminary reconstructions by mapping neural spike signals to latent representations. In the second stage, regression models map neural spike signals to CLIP-Vision and CLIP-Text features, enabling Versatile Diffusion to refine the images via image-to-image generation.\n  We evaluate our approach on the Allen Visual Coding-Neuropixels dataset and analyze different brain regions. Our results show that the VISI region exhibits the most prominent activation and plays a key role in reconstruction quality. We present both successful and unsuccessful reconstruction examples, reflecting the challenges of decoding neural activity.

The key findings include: 1) MXFP8 consistently achieves near-lossless performance, while MXFP4 introduces substantial accuracy degradation and remains challenging; 2) PTQ effectiveness under MXFP depends strongly on format compatibility, with some algorithmic paradigms being consistently more effective than others; 3) PTQ performance exhibits highly consistent trends across model families and modalities, in particular, quantization sensitivity is dominated by the language model rather than the vision encoder in multimodal LLMs; 4) The scaling factor of quantization is a critical error source in MXFP4, and a simple pre-scale optimization strategy can significantly mitigate its impact.

This reveals a clear structure in CD-OD: transfer within the same setting type is relatively stable, while transfer across setting types drops substantially and is often asymmetric. The most severe breakdowns occur when transferring from specific sources to agnostic targets, and persist after open-label alignment, indicating that domain shift dominates in the hardest regimes. To disentangle domain shift from label mismatch, we compare closed-label transfer with an open-label protocol that maps predicted classes to the nearest target label using CLIP similarity. Open-label evaluation yields consistent but bounded gains, and many corrected cases correspond to semantic near-misses supported by the image evidence.

While straightforward, this approach is sensitive to label noise and neglects whether one sample is more positive than another, resulting in unstable predictions and poor correlation alignment. Pairwise ordinal learning frameworks emerged to address this gap, capturing relative order by learning from comparisons. Yet, they introduce two new trade-offs: First, they assign uniform importance to all comparisons, failing to adaptively focus on hard-to-rank samples. Second, they employ static ranking margins, which fail to reflect the varying semantic distances between sentiment groups. To address this, we propose a Two-Stage Group-wise Ranking and Calibration Framework (GRCF) that adapts the philosophy of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our framework resolves these trade-offs by simultaneously preserving relative ordinal structure, ensuring absolute score calibration, and adaptively focusing on difficult samples. Specifically, Stage 1 introduces a GRPO-inspired Advantage-Weighted Dynamic Margin Ranking Loss to build a fine-grained ordinal structure. Stage 2 then employs an MAE-driven objective to align prediction magnitudes. To validate its generalizability, we extend GRCF to classification tasks, including multimodal humor detection and sarcasm detection.

In contrast, our proposed joint fine-tuning framework significantly enhances model performance by enabling targeted adaptation to domain-specific reasoning demands, highlighting the advantages of structured multi-task learning in improving both accuracy and interpretability.

To compare model quality, voting-based leaderboards have become the standard, relying on anonymized model outputs for fairness. In this work, we show that such anonymity can be easily broken. We find that generations from each T2I model form distinctive clusters in the image embedding space, enabling accurate deanonymization without prompt control or training data. Using 22 models and 280 prompts (150K images), our centroid-based method achieves high accuracy and reveals systematic model-specific signatures. We further introduce a prompt-level distinguishability metric and conduct large-scale analyses showing how certain prompts can lead to near-perfect distinguishability. Our findings expose fundamental security flaws in T2I leaderboards and motivate stronger anonymization defenses."}

Prior methods either require multi-view capture and expensive differentiable simulation or predict only garment geometry without the material properties required for realistic simulation. We propose a feed-forward framework that sidesteps these limitations by first fine-tuning a vision-language model to infer material composition and fabric attributes from real images, and then training a lightweight predictor that maps these attributes to the corresponding physical fabric parameters using a small dataset of material-physics measurements. Our approach introduces two new datasets (FTAG and T2P) and delivers simulation-ready garments from a single image without iterative optimization. Experiments show that our estimator achieves superior accuracy in material composition estimation and fabric attribute prediction, and by passing them through our physics parameter estimator, we further achieve higher-fidelity simulations compared to state-of-the-art image-to-garment methods."}

We introduce LiteEmbed, a lightweight framework for few-shot personalization of CLIP that enables new classes to be added without retraining its encoders. LiteEmbed performs subspace-guided optimization of text embeddings within CLIP's vocabulary, leveraging a PCA-based decomposition that disentangles coarse semantic directions from fine-grained variations. Two complementary objectives, coarse alignment and fine separation, jointly preserve global semantic consistency while enhancing discriminability among visually similar classes. Once optimized, the embeddings are plug-and-play, seamlessly substituting CLIP's original text features across classification, retrieval, segmentation, and detection tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial gains over prior methods, establishing LiteEmbed as an effective approach for adapting CLIP to underrepresented, rare, or unseen classes."}

Traditional methods require extensive manual annotation, while existing self-supervised approaches are computationally demanding and ill-suited for long sequences due to memory constraints and temporal error propagation. We introduce a highly efficient, self-supervised method that reframes animal identification as a global clustering task rather than a sequential tracking problem. Our approach assumes a known, fixed number of individuals within a single video -- a common scenario in practice -- and requires only bounding box detections and the total count. By sampling pairs of frames, using a frozen pre-trained backbone, and employing a self-bootstrapping mechanism with the Hungarian algorithm for in-batch pseudo-label assignment, our method learns discriminative features without identity labels. We adapt a Binary Cross Entropy loss from vision-language models, enabling state-of-the-art accuracy ($>$97\\%) while consuming less than 1 GB of GPU memory per batch -- an order of magnitude less than standard contrastive methods. Evaluated on challenging real-world datasets (3D-POP pigeons and 8-calves feeding videos), our framework matches or surpasses supervised baselines trained on over 1,000 labeled frames, effectively removing the manual annotation bottleneck. This work enables practical, high-accuracy animal identification on consumer-grade hardware, with broad applicability in resource-constrained research settings.

This inefficiency poses a critical barrier to deploying generative video in applications that require real-time interactions, such as embodied AI and VR/AR. This paper explores a new strategy for camera-conditioned video generation of static scenes: using diffusion-based generative models to generate a sparse set of keyframes, and then synthesizing the full video through 3D reconstruction and rendering. By lifting keyframes into a 3D representation and rendering intermediate views, our approach amortizes the generation cost across hundreds of frames while enforcing geometric consistency. We further introduce a model that predicts the optimal number of keyframes for a given camera trajectory, allowing the system to adaptively allocate computation. Our final method, SRENDER, uses very sparse keyframes for simple trajectories and denser ones for complex camera motion. This results in video generation that is more than 40 times faster than the diffusion-based baseline in generating 20 seconds of video, while maintaining high visual fidelity and temporal stability, offering a practical path toward efficient and controllable video synthesis."}

We propose Fast-ThinkAct, an efficient reasoning framework that achieves compact yet performant planning through verbalizable latent reasoning. Fast-ThinkAct learns to reason efficiently with latent CoTs by distilling from a teacher, driven by a preference-guided objective to align manipulation trajectories that transfers both linguistic and visual planning capabilities for embodied control. This enables reasoning-enhanced policy learning that effectively connects compact reasoning to action execution. Extensive experiments across diverse embodied manipulation and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-ThinkAct achieves strong performance with up to 89.3\\% reduced inference latency over state-of-the-art reasoning VLAs, while maintaining effective long-horizon planning, few-shot adaptation, and failure recovery."}

Yet conventional Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions in aviation remain siloed and narrow, focusing on isolated tasks or single modalities. They struggle to integrate heterogeneous data such as voice communications, radar tracks, sensor streams and textual reports, which limits situational awareness, adaptability, and real-time decision support. This paper introduces the vision of AviationLMM, a Large Multimodal foundation Model for civil aviation, designed to unify the heterogeneous data streams of civil aviation and enable understanding, reasoning, generation and agentic applications. We firstly identify the gaps between existing AI solutions and requirements. Secondly, we describe the model architecture that ingests multimodal inputs such as air-ground voice, surveillance, on-board telemetry, video and structured texts, and performs cross-modal alignment and fusion, and produces flexible outputs ranging from situation summaries and risk alerts to predictive diagnostics and multimodal incident reconstructions. In order to fully realize this vision, we identify key research opportunities to address, including data acquisition, alignment and fusion, pretraining, reasoning, trustworthiness, privacy, robustness to missing modalities, and synthetic scenario generation. By articulating the design and challenges of AviationLMM, we aim to boost the civil aviation foundation model progress and catalyze coordinated research efforts toward an integrated, trustworthy and privacy-preserving aviation AI ecosystem."}
