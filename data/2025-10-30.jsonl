At its core,\nM-ACM leverages motion representations derived from human mesh recovery to\nexplicitly highlight human body dynamics, thereby reducing hallucinations and\nimproving both semantic fidelity and spatial alignment in the generated\ncaptions.

However, few studies have\nexplored their joint integration for auxiliary AD diagnosis. In this study, we\npropose a multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework that synergistically\nleverages eye-tracking and facial features for AD detection.

However, prior work often overlooks the tight\ncoupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex\ninter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device\nmulti-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding.\nInstead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire\ninference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units,\nallowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also\nintroduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that\ncaptures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain\naccuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for\nfine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during\ninference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and\ninput data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration\noptimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for\neach modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping\nmechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early\npredictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public\nmultimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle\n(UAV)-based multimodal testbed. The results show that MMEdge significantly\nreduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various\nsystem and data dynamics."}

To address these challenges, We introduce\nStreamingCoT, the first dataset explicitly designed for temporally evolving\nreasoning in streaming VideoQA and multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tasks. Our\nframework first establishes a dynamic hierarchical annotation architecture that\ngenerates per-second dense descriptions and constructs temporally-dependent\nsemantic segments through similarity fusion, paired with question-answer sets\nconstrained by temporal evolution patterns. We further propose an explicit\nreasoning chain generation paradigm that extracts spatiotemporal objects via\nkeyframe semantic alignment, derives object state transition-based reasoning\npaths using large language models, and ensures logical coherence through\nhuman-verified validation. This dataset establishes a foundation for advancing\nresearch in streaming video understanding, complex temporal reasoning, and\nmultimodal inference.

The goal is to retrieve images that contain\nthe same particular object as the visual query, presented under a variety of\nmodifications defined by textual queries.
