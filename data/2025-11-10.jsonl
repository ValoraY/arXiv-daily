By\nemploying lemmatization and fine-tuning techniques, the system aligns semantic\ncues from textual inputs with visual features, enhancing detection precision\nfor small and complex objects. Experimental validation using the COCO and\nObjects365 datasets demonstrates that the model achieves superior performance.\nOn the COCO2017 validation set, it attains a 52.6% average precision (AP),\noutperforming YOLO-World significantly while maintaining half the parameter\nconsumption of Transformer-based models like GLIP. Several test on different of\nbackbones such ELAN, MSP, and CSP further enable efficient handling of\nmulti-scale objects, ensuring scalability and robustness in\nresource-constrained environments. This study underscores the potential of\nintegrating natural language understanding with advanced backbone\narchitectures, setting new benchmarks in object detection accuracy, efficiency,\nand adaptability to real-world challenges."}

Official code:\n  https://github.com/Time-Search/TimeSearch-R", "summary": "Temporal search aims to identify a minimal set of relevant frames from tens\nof thousands based on a given query, serving as a foundation for accurate\nlong-form video understanding. Existing works attempt to progressively narrow\nthe search space. However, these approaches typically rely on a hand-crafted\nsearch process, lacking end-to-end optimization for learning optimal search\nstrategies. In this paper, we propose TimeSearch-R, which reformulates temporal\nsearch as interleaved text-video thinking, seamlessly integrating searching\nvideo clips into the reasoning process through reinforcement learning (RL).\nHowever, applying RL training methods, such as Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO), to video reasoning can result in unsupervised intermediate\nsearch decisions. This leads to insufficient exploration of the video content\nand inconsistent logical reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce GRPO\nwith Completeness Self-Verification (GRPO-CSV), which gathers searched video\nframes from the interleaved reasoning process and utilizes the same policy\nmodel to verify the adequacy of searched frames, thereby improving the\ncompleteness of video reasoning. Additionally, we construct datasets\nspecifically designed for the SFT cold-start and RL training of GRPO-CSV,\nfiltering out samples with weak temporal dependencies to enhance task\ndifficulty and improve temporal search capabilities. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that TimeSearch-R achieves significant improvements on temporal\nsearch benchmarks such as Haystack-LVBench and Haystack-Ego4D, as well as\nlong-form video understanding benchmarks like VideoMME and MLVU. Notably,\nTimeSearch-R establishes a new state-of-the-art on LongVideoBench with 4.1%\nimprovement over the base model Qwen2.5-VL and 2.0% over the advanced video\nreasoning model Video-R1.

Several previous studies have tried to enhance\nthe spatial awareness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by adding extra expert\nencoders, which brings extra overhead and usually harms general capabilities.\nTo enhance the spatial ability in general architectures, we introduce Visual\nSpatial Tuning (VST), a comprehensive framework to cultivate VLMs with\nhuman-like visuospatial abilities, from spatial perception to reasoning. We\nfirst attempt to enhance spatial perception in VLMs by constructing a\nlarge-scale dataset termed VST-P, which comprises 4.1 million samples spanning\n19 skills across single views, multiple images, and videos. Then, we present\nVST-R, a curated dataset with 135K samples that instruct models to reason in\nspace. In particular, we adopt a progressive training pipeline: supervised\nfine-tuning to build foundational spatial knowledge, followed by reinforcement\nlearning to further improve spatial reasoning abilities. Without the\nside-effect to general capabilities, the proposed VST consistently achieves\nstate-of-the-art results on several spatial benchmarks, including $34.8\\%$ on\nMMSI-Bench and $61.2\\%$ on VSIBench. It turns out that the\nVision-Language-Action models can be significantly enhanced with the proposed\nspatial tuning paradigm, paving the way for more physically grounded AI."}
