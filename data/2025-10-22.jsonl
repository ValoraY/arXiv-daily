Existing data\nselection methods aim to mitigate this by selecting important and diverse\nsubsets, but they often suffer from two critical drawbacks: high computational\noverhead from processing the entire dataset and suboptimal data selection due\nto separate treatment of importance and diversity.\n  We introduce CoIDO, a novel dual-objective framework that jointly optimizes\ndata importance and diversity to overcome these challenges. Unlike existing\napproaches that require costly evaluations across the whole dataset, CoIDO\nemploys a lightweight plug-in scorer. This scorer is trained on just a small\nrandom sample of data to learn the distribution of the candidate set,\ndrastically reducing computational demands. By leveraging a homoscedastic\nuncertainty-based formulation, CoIDO effectively balances importance and\ndiversity during training, enabling efficient and scalable data selection.\n  In our experiments, we trained the CoIDO scorer using only 20 percent of\nrandomly sampled data. Once trained, CoIDO was applied to the entire dataset to\nselect a 20 percent subset for instruction tuning. On the widely used\nLLaVA-1.5-7B model across ten downstream tasks, this selected subset achieved\nan impressive 98.2 percent of the performance of full-data fine-tuning, on\naverage."}

Zero-shot learning models rely on\nlearning an embedding space, where both semantic descriptions of classes and\nvisual features of instances can be embedded for nearest neighbor search.\nRecently, most of the existing works consider the visual space formulated by\ndeep visual features as an ideal choice of the embedding space.

We argue that optimizing the visual space is crucial as it allows\nsemantic vectors to be embedded into the visual space more effectively. In this\nwork, we propose two strategies to accomplish this purpose. One is the visual\nprototype based method, which learns a visual prototype for each visual class,\nso that, in the visual space, a class can be represented by a prototype feature\ninstead of a series of discrete visual features. The other is to optimize the\nvisual feature structure in an intermediate embedding space, and in this method\nwe successfully devise a multilayer perceptron framework based algorithm that\nis able to learn the common intermediate embedding space and meanwhile to make\nthe visual data structure more distinctive.

Recently, cross-modal\nscene semantic information has been shown to play a crucial role in various\ncomputer vision tasks, particularly those involving perceptual understanding.\nHowever, the exploration of cross-modal scene semantic information in the\ncontext of ICA remains unaddressed. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a\nnovel ICA method called Cross-Modal Scene Semantic Alignment (CM-SSA), which\nleverages scene semantic alignment from a cross-modal perspective to enhance\nICA performance, enabling complexity predictions to be more consistent with\nsubjective human perception. Specifically, the proposed CM-SSA consists of a\ncomplexity regression branch and a scene semantic alignment branch. The\ncomplexity regression branch estimates image complexity levels under the\nguidance of the scene semantic alignment branch, while the scene semantic\nalignment branch is used to align images with corresponding text prompts that\nconvey rich scene semantic information by pair-wise learning. Extensive\nexperiments on several ICA datasets demonstrate that the proposed CM-SSA\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Our comprehensive evaluation of over 20 prominent models reveals a\nnuanced landscape: despite the continued dominance of proprietary models, the\nperformance gap is closing, with top-tier open-source solutions now achieving\nnear-parity. Furthermore, we find that models specialized for dense captioning\nunderperform general-purpose MLLMs on complex instructions, indicating that\nfuture work should simultaneously advance both descriptive richness and\ninstruction-following fidelity."}

Existing\napproaches typically depend on either single-level semantics or manually\ndesigned abstract hierarchies, which limit their generalizability and\nscalability. To address these limitations, we introduce a SEmantic-aware\nhierArchical Learning framework (SEAL), guided by naturally occurring and\neasily accessible hierarchical structures. Within SEAL, we propose a\nHierarchical Semantic-Guided Soft Contrastive Learning approach that exploits\nhierarchical similarity to generate informative soft negatives, addressing the\nlimitations of conventional contrastive losses that treat all negatives\nequally. Furthermore, a Cross-Granularity Consistency (CGC) module is designed\nto align the predictions from different levels of granularity. SEAL\nconsistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained benchmarks,\nincluding the SSB benchmark, Oxford-Pet, and the Herbarium19 dataset, and\nfurther demonstrates generalization on coarse-grained datasets.

In addition, the CLIP text encoder lacks\nsupport for multilingual inputs. All these limitations significantly restrict\nits applicability across a broader range of tasks. Recent studies have\nattempted to replace the CLIP text encoder with an LLM-based embedder to\nenhance its ability in processing long texts, multilingual understanding, and\nfine-grained semantic comprehension. However, because the representation spaces\nof LLMs and the vision-language space of CLIP are pretrained independently\nwithout alignment priors, direct alignment using contrastive learning can\ndisrupt the intrinsic vision-language alignment in the CLIP image encoder,\nleading to an underutilization of the knowledge acquired during pre-training.\nTo address this challenge, we propose ProCLIP, a curriculum learning-based\nprogressive vision-language alignment framework to effectively align the CLIP\nimage encoder with an LLM-based embedder. Specifically, ProCLIP first distills\nknowledge from CLIP's text encoder into the LLM-based embedder to leverage\nCLIP's rich pretrained knowledge while establishing initial alignment between\nthe LLM embedder and CLIP image encoder. Subsequently, ProCLIP further aligns\nthe CLIP image encoder with the LLM-based embedder through image-text\ncontrastive tuning, employing self-distillation regularization to avoid\noverfitting. To achieve a more effective alignment, instance semantic alignment\nloss and embedding structure alignment loss are employed during representation\ninheritance and contrastive tuning.

However, domain shift and label heterogeneity across clients often\nhinder the generalization of the aggregated global model. Recently, large-scale\nvision-language models like CLIP have shown strong zero-shot classification\ncapabilities, raising the question of how to effectively fine-tune CLIP across\ndomains in a federated setting. In this work, we propose an adaptive federated\nprompt tuning framework, FedDEAP, to enhance CLIP's generalization in\nmulti-domain scenarios. Our method includes the following three key components:\n(1) To mitigate the loss of domain-specific information caused by\nlabel-supervised tuning, we disentangle semantic and domain-specific features\nin images by using semantic and domain transformation networks with unbiased\nmappings; (2) To preserve domain-specific knowledge during global prompt\naggregation, we introduce a dual-prompt design with a global semantic prompt\nand a local domain prompt to balance shared and personalized information; (3)\nTo maximize the inclusion of semantic and domain information from images in the\ngenerated text features, we align textual and visual representations under the\ntwo learned transformations to preserve semantic and domain consistency.\nTheoretical analysis and extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method in enhancing the generalization of CLIP for\nfederated image recognition across multiple domains."}

Modern large language models (LLMs), however, rely on subword\ntokenization, fragmenting text into pieces from a fixed vocabulary. While\neffective for high-resource languages, this approach over-segments low-resource\nlanguages, yielding long, linguistically meaningless sequences and inflating\ncomputation. In this work, we challenge this entrenched paradigm and move\ntoward a vision-centric alternative. Our method, SeeTok, renders text as images\n(visual-text) and leverages pretrained multimodal LLMs to interpret them,\nreusing strong OCR and text-vision alignment abilities learned from large-scale\nmultimodal training.

However, due to the inherent stochasticity of T2I models, different\nnoise inputs often lead to outputs with varying perceptual quality. Although\nthis randomness is sometimes seen as a limitation, it also introduces a wider\nperceptual quality range, which can be exploited to improve Real-ISR\nperformance. To this end, we introduce Direct Perceptual Preference\nOptimization for Real-ISR (DP$^2$O-SR), a framework that aligns generative\nmodels with perceptual preferences without requiring costly human annotations.\nWe construct a hybrid reward signal by combining full-reference and\nno-reference image quality assessment (IQA) models trained on large-scale human\npreference datasets. This reward encourages both structural fidelity and\nnatural appearance. To better utilize perceptual diversity, we move beyond the\nstandard best-vs-worst selection and construct multiple preference pairs from\noutputs of the same model. Our analysis reveals that the optimal selection\nratio depends on model capacity: smaller models benefit from broader coverage,\nwhile larger models respond better to stronger contrast in supervision.\nFurthermore, we propose hierarchical preference optimization, which adaptively\nweights training pairs based on intra-group reward gaps and inter-group\ndiversity, enabling more efficient and stable learning. Extensive experiments\nacross both diffusion- and flow-based T2I backbones demonstrate that DP$^2$O-SR\nsignificantly improves perceptual quality and generalizes well to real-world\nbenchmarks."}
