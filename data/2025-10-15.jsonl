A tracking error of just a few pixels would lead to the collapse\nof the visual object representation, not to mention occlusions and large motion\nfrequently occurring in videos. To overcome the above mentioned vulnerability,\nthis work proposes spatio-temporally consistent proxy nodes to represent\ndynamically changing objects/scenes in the video. On the one hand, the\nhierarchical proxy nodes have the ability to stably express the multi-scale\nstructure of visual objects, so they are not affected by accumulated tracking\nerror, long-term motion, occlusion, and viewpoint variation. On the other hand,\nthe dynamic representation update mechanism of the proxy nodes adequately\nleverages spatio-temporal priors of the video to mitigate the impact of\ninaccurate trackers, thereby effectively handling drastic changes in scenes and\nobjects. Additionally, the decoupled encoding manner of the shape and texture\nrepresentations across different visual objects in the video facilitates\ncontrollable and fine-grained appearance editing capability.

We present the Flow Poke Transformer (FPT), a novel framework for\ndirectly predicting the distribution of local motion, conditioned on sparse\ninteractions termed \"pokes\". Unlike traditional methods that typically only\nenable dense sampling of a single realization of scene dynamics, FPT provides\nan interpretable directly accessible representation of multi-modal scene\nmotion, its dependency on physical interactions and the inherent uncertainties\nof scene dynamics. We also evaluate our model on several downstream tasks to\nenable comparisons with prior methods and highlight the flexibility of our\napproach. On dense face motion generation, our generic pre-trained model\nsurpasses specialized baselines. FPT can be fine-tuned in strongly\nout-of-distribution tasks such as synthetic datasets to enable significant\nimprovements over in-domain methods in articulated object motion estimation.\nAdditionally, predicting explicit motion distributions directly enables our\nmethod to achieve competitive performance on tasks like moving part\nsegmentation from pokes which further demonstrates the versatility of our FPT.\nCode and models are publicly available at\nhttps://compvis.github.io/flow-poke-transformer."}

However, a significant gap exists where\na model's strong visual understanding often fails to transfer to its visual\ngeneration. A model might correctly understand an image based on user\ninstructions, yet be unable to generate a faithful image from text prompts.\nThis phenomenon directly raises a compelling question: Can a model achieve\nself-improvement by using its understanding module to reward its generation\nmodule? To bridge this gap and achieve self-improvement, we introduce SRUM, a\nself-rewarding post-training framework that can be directly applied to existing\nUMMs of various designs. SRUM creates a feedback loop where the model's own\nunderstanding module acts as an internal ``evaluator'', providing corrective\nsignals to improve its generation module, without requiring additional\nhuman-labeled data. To ensure this feedback is comprehensive, we designed a\nglobal-local dual reward system. To tackle the inherent structural complexity\nof images, this system offers multi-scale guidance: a \\textbf{global reward}\nensures the correctness of the overall visual semantics and layout, while a\n\\textbf{local reward} refines fine-grained, object-level fidelity. SRUM leads\nto powerful capabilities and shows strong generalization, boosting performance\non T2I-CompBench from 82.18 to \\textbf{88.37} and on T2I-ReasonBench from 43.82\nto \\textbf{46.75}. Overall, our work establishes a powerful new paradigm for\nenabling a UMMs' understanding module to guide and enhance its own generation\nvia self-rewarding."}

Prior attempts to bridge this gap often use\nthe last layer information from VLM, employ multiple visual encoders, or train\nlarge unified models jointly for text and image generation, which demands\nsubstantial computational resources and large-scale data, limiting its\naccessibility.We present UniFusion, a diffusion-based generative model\nconditioned on a frozen large vision-language model (VLM) that serves as a\nunified multimodal encoder. At the core of UniFusion is the Layerwise Attention\nPooling (LAP) mechanism that extracts both high level semantics and low level\ndetails from text and visual tokens of a frozen VLM to condition a diffusion\ngenerative model. We demonstrate that LAP outperforms other shallow fusion\narchitectures on text-image alignment for generation and faithful transfer of\nvisual information from VLM to the diffusion model which is key for editing. We\npropose VLM-Enabled Rewriting Injection with Flexibile Inference (VERIFI),\nwhich conditions a diffusion transformer (DiT) only on the text tokens\ngenerated by the VLM during in-model prompt rewriting. VERIFI combines the\nalignment of the conditioning distribution with the VLM's reasoning\ncapabilities for increased capabilities and flexibility at inference. In\naddition, finetuning on editing task not only improves text-image alignment for\ngeneration, indicative of cross-modality knowledge transfer, but also exhibits\ntremendous generalization capabilities. Our model when trained on single image\nediting, zero-shot generalizes to multiple image references further motivating\nthe unified encoder design of UniFusion."}

The key idea behind our\nmethod is to employ multiple MLP connectors, each with a different image\ncompression ratio, to downsample the vision tokens based on the semantic\ncomplexity of the image. During training, we minimize the KL divergence between\nthe responses conditioned on different MLP connectors.

To remedy this, we propose\n\\textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to\npredict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that\ncompels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment.\nWe showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA\narchetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual\ntokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual\nfeatures. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we\nintroduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for\nreal-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a\n680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly\noutperforms BEV and VLA baselines.

On\nbenchmarks like COCO and LVIS, Rex-Omni attains performance comparable to or\nexceeding regression-based models (e.g., DINO, Grounding DINO) in a zero-shot\nsetting.

With recent progress in audio-visual technologies, Omni\nLanguage Models (OLMs), capable of processing audio and video signals in\nparallel, have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving richer\nunderstanding and reasoning. However, their capacity to capture and describe\nfine-grained details remains limited explored. In this work, we present a\nsystematic and comprehensive investigation of omni detailed perception from the\nperspectives of the data pipeline, models, and benchmark.

Based on the data generated with Omni-Detective,\nwe train two captioning models: Audio-Captioner for audio-only detailed\nperception, and Omni-Captioner for audio-visual detailed perception. Under the\ncascade evaluation protocol, Audio-Captioner achieves the best performance on\nMMAU and MMAR among all open-source models, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash and\ndelivering performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Pro. On existing detailed\ncaptioning benchmarks, Omni-Captioner sets a new state-of-the-art on VDC and\nachieves the best trade-off between detail and hallucination on the\nvideo-SALMONN 2 testset.
